## Proposal: Mobile Optimization of Arch LTD Website

- **Prepared for:** ARCH Consultants Ltd. 
- **Prepared by:** Jesse Trippe

---

## Scope of Work
The goal is to make the current desktop-only site (**archltd.com**) fully responsive and mobile-friendly. Work will include:

- Setting up a test/staging version of the site  
- Updating layouts from fixed dimensions to fluid, percentage-based sizing  
- Adding three responsive breakpoints for different viewport widths  
- Adjusting layouts so elements reflow cleanly (e.g. stacking vertically on smaller screens)  
- Sharing an initial pass for review, incorporating feedback, and finalizing  
- Providing light troubleshooting support after launch to resolve any new issues that surface  

This work is focused on optimizing the existing design — no new content or brand-new features will be added.

---

## Deliverables
- A responsive, mobile-optimized version of **archltd.com**  
- Review cycles to ensure the layout meets expectations  
- Final deployment to the live site  
- Post-launch troubleshooting to address any issues discovered shortly after go-live  

---

## Estimated Hours & Cost
- **Estimated effort:** 30–40 hours  
- **Hourly rate:** $75/hour  
- **Projected total:** $2,250 – $3,000  

---

## Timeline
Work will be completed part-time. The overall pace will depend somewhat on the speed of feedback, but the project should be comfortably wrapped up within **4–6 weeks from kickoff**.  

---

## Out of Scope
This proposal does not include:  
- Adding brand-new design elements or content  
- Ongoing long-term maintenance beyond the initial troubleshooting window  

If future updates are needed, I’ll be glad to provide a separate estimate.

## Acceptance
If everything looks good, please sign below so we can get started.  
I’m excited to get the site running smoothly across all devices!
