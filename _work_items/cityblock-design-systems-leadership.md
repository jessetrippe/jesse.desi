## Overview

At Cityblock Health, I lead the design system from the design side. This work sits alongside my product design projects but spans the entire platform and team. It includes maintaining the system itself, managing outside contractors, driving accessibility improvements, and building processes that give every designer ownership over shared tools.

This isn't a single project with a start and end date. It's ongoing work that makes everything else possible.

## Design System Ownership

### Figma Restructure

I set up a completely new view in Figma for our design system. The previous structure had grown organically and was hard to navigate. Components were scattered, naming was inconsistent, and designers couldn't find what they needed.

The new structure organizes components by type, includes clear documentation for each, and mirrors how components are organized in Storybook.

### Storybook Audit

I audited every component in Storybook against what existed in Figma. Many components had been built in code but never added to the design file. Others existed in Figma but had drifted from the implementation.

I created tickets for every missing or mismatched component, then delegated the Figma work across the design team. This closed the gap between what designers could use and what engineers had built.

### Icon Cleanup

Our icon usage had grown messy. Custom one-offs had been added for specific features. Styling was inconsistent. Some icons were duplicates with different names.

I audited the full set, established consistent styling rules, removed unused icons, and replaced custom one-offs with standardized versions. The result was a smaller, more coherent icon library that's easier to maintain.

### Code Contributions

I fix issues in the design system directly in code as well as in Figma. When a component needs a tweak or a bug surfaces, I can make the change myself rather than waiting for engineering bandwidth. This keeps the system moving and reduces bottlenecks.

## Accessibility

### Audit and Implementation

I managed an outside contractor who audited our marketing site and platform for accessibility issues. The audit surfaced problems with color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and semantic markup.

After the audit, I led the effort to implement the findings. This included fixes on both the public marketing site and the internal Commons platform. I prioritized issues by severity and worked with engineering to address them systematically.

## Team Processes

### Design Studios

I organized our Design Studios, regular sessions where designers review work in progress and share feedback. These sessions keep the team aligned on what's being built across the platform and create space for critique.

I was an active participant and provided direct, constructive feedback. Studios work best when people are honest, so I tried to model that.

### Mentorship

I mentored junior designers through monthly touch-bases. These weren't formal reviews but regular conversations about their work, career questions, and challenges they were facing. The goal was to give them a consistent sounding board outside of project work.

### Rotating Ownership

I set up a rotating role where each designer takes responsibility for the design system for a period of time. This means everyone contributes to the system, improves it, and feels ownership over it.

Before this, the design system was "someone else's problem." Now it's shared infrastructure that the whole team maintains.

## Managing Contractors

I managed two outside contractors during my time at Cityblock:

**Visual Design Contractor**
Helped with visual design work on the design system itself. I scoped the work, provided direction, reviewed deliverables, and integrated their contributions into the system.

**Accessibility Contractor**
Conducted the accessibility audit of our marketing site and platform. I managed the engagement, reviewed findings, and translated the audit into actionable work for the team.

## What This Work Enabled

Design systems and processes aren't glamorous, but they're what let a team move fast without breaking things.

- **Designers can find and use components quickly** because the Figma structure makes sense
- **Code and design stay in sync** because we audit and maintain parity
- **Accessibility isn't an afterthought** because we built it into our process
- **The whole team owns the system** because everyone rotates through responsibility
- **Junior designers grow** because they have regular mentorship and real feedback

This is the work that doesn't show up in a case study but makes every case study possible.
