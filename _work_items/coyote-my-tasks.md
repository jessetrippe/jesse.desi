Coyote provides shippers with real-time delivery tracking through web and mobile apps. Location information comes from drivers using Coyote's mobile app or website. But when carriers fail to update, Coyote representatives have to call drivers manually for location updates, taking time away from booking new freight.

Stakeholders predicted that an improved experience for updating loads could double self-tracking to 40%. I worked with a stakeholder, a business analyst, and a development team in Pune, India to solve this problem.

Our solution was a landing page that presents users with outstanding tasks and a quick way to complete them.

## Sketches

The paper and pen phase was quick, used to explore a few solutions. The team met and decided on one direction. Requirements gathering was straightforward since most tasks were already defined elsewhere in the app. The hard part was deciding when a task became important enough to warrant a spot on this page, since carrier users have many tasks to complete.

## Wireframes

After wireframing the solution and running user tests with carriers and the reps who manually track them, we found a problem. Gathering all tasks into one interface solved half the problem, but sending users to other areas of the site to complete each task slowed them down.

We decided to add an actionable sidebar so users could complete tasks without leaving the page.

## Final Design

Adding the actionable sidebar increased the effort considerably, so we built the project in phases, allowing other projects to take priority in between.

With each phase release, self-tracking increased, eventually surpassing our 40% goal. Other parts of the business saw this feature and began developing their own My Tasks pages to solve similar problems.
