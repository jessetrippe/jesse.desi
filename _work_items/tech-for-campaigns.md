Tech for Campaigns pairs tech volunteers with local, state, and national political campaigns that need help. In June 2018, I joined a growth team tasked with increasing the volunteer database. The team included myself as UX designer, a developer, a social marketing manager, and a product manager.

The problem was the sign-up form. It was long, daunting, and buried under branding elements that distracted from the goal. The link to volunteer was getting lost in the navigation. Some form fields weren't even being used by the organization.

We split the project into two phases and tested along the way.

## Wireframes Phase One

I audited the website and sign-up flow, outlining problems and opportunities that likely affected completion rates. I presented findings during a brainstorming session and we established a goal to significantly increase form completion.

Phase one focused on removing unused fields and reorganizing the form. I grouped related fields, sectioned them off from others, and made the volunteer link more prominent. The branding elements were taking up disproportionate space relative to the organization's goals, so I reduced them.

We also added an email-only sign-up for non-tech visitors. This created a database of people who could be vetted and potentially converted to volunteers, plus a pool for traditional campaigning or fundraising.

I wireframed the changes, got approval from the founders, then moved into Photoshop/Sketch and began making changes to the production site.

## Final Design Phase One

After getting approval on wireframes and design direction, I explored further in Photoshop and Sketch. We settled on a final design and implemented it.

Results: 13% increase in volunteer form submissions. We also added a significant number of email-only users who could convert to volunteers later.

## Wireframes Phase Two

Phase two transformed the one-page form into a multi-step wizard. Our assumption: grouping related fields and ordering steps sequentially would reduce cognitive load and increase conversion.

I split the form into four steps, designed a progress bar, and added placeholders for intro text and icons. After feedback from the team, I got approval from the founders and moved into final design.

## Final Design Phase Two

I worked with the marketing team on title and helper text for each step. After a few rounds of back-and-forth, the team agreed on icons I pitched. I rebuilt them in Illustrator and Sketch using Tech for Campaigns' red and blue colors.

While I completed the design work, the developer built the step-based form in Drupal. I wrote the CSS to match my designs and added the icons in SVG form. We tested thoroughly and launched.

Results: volunteer sign-ups over unique homepage visitors increased from 8% to 33%.
