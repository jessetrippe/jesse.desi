A friend built a Slack app that randomly pairs employees and schedules lunch dates to promote inter-office communication. As the product grew, the marketing website fell behind. The content was outdated and the design looked stale.

I refreshed both the content and the design. The update improved the visitor-to-install ratio and gave the owner a site they were proud to share.
