The largest project I worked on at Coyote was their business-to-business Transportation Management System (TMS), a web platform for shippers and trucking companies to manage freight.

Working with a team of 20 developers, I was responsible for every page's overall design and user interface, the implementation and maintenance of the app's CSS framework and HTML, and occasional copywriting. This required effective communication, teamwork, and attention to detail.

As with most projects at Coyote, my responsibilities grew to span multiple roles: Business Analyst, Quality Assurance Tester, UX Designer, and UI Designer.
