I joined the Barack Obama 2012 reelection campaign as a front-end developer. My responsibilities included creating and maintaining donation forms with front-end validation, error handling, embedded video, mobile layouts, A/B testing, and constant modifications and troubleshooting.

I was also solely responsible for developing the campaign's Tumblr. This required learning Tumblr's templating language and defining mobile breakpoints and layouts.
