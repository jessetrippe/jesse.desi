**_Concepts / features we introduced:_**

- Group my Member (launched this with a pilot group, got feedback, it proved to not be very popular for various reasons, failed fast and sunset this feature. Took the learnings and applied it to the new Inbox)
- Tasks due today
- Tasks due this week
- Regular Check-ins based on Track
  - responsive
  - focused
  - intensive
  - Prevetive Care Physician (this drastically reduced the amount support we needed to hire for each new market. It setup our least vulnerable most healthy group with the ability to call us with issues but other wise left the patient alone. This allowed the company to hire less and to direct attention to our most vulnerable/needy population). This was another test pilot that parts seemed to be successful and other parts were not successful.
- Tasks assigned to a regular check-in
- Recurring tasks

**_Sunset Commons home page_**

- Member feed (this was replaced with REgular Check-ins Inbox Folder)
- To do list (Care team members no longer had to build daily to do lists as we solved this with Due Today and Regular Check-ins in the Inbox)
- Google Calendar integration (found that users weren't using it using Pendo data)

**_Member 360 page_**

- Retired many widgets from the page
- Created a HEalth Summary widget to summarize enrolled programs and clinical measures
- Created an Opportunities widget to organize all of the platform level recommendations and eligibility for a member. This was a way for Cityblock to push their own intiatives (e.g. quality measures) to make money along with medical interventiosna and clinical programs to help improve health outcomes.

Spent the beginning of the project meeting with users, interviews, gathering feedback.
Built a quick prototype called Group by member.
Built a small pilot group of active users in a Slack channel.
Turned the feature on for them for 1 week.
Gather feedback.
Then launched a more thorough research study to see how users in different markets completed work - who to call, when to call them, what to discuss, and all in what order.
Presented that to the larger group and put together a plan that helped launch a new way of working.
New way of working was to take what some markets were already doing and bake it into the platform and then get all markets on to the same standard of work.
This was done in a few different places/concepts:

- Introduce Regular Check-ins - these are phone calls to members every 30, 60, 90 days based on their Track (or medical condition/needs)
- Put Regular Check-ins folder in the Inbox which where most users spend their day prioritizing and completing work
- Sunsetted the manual process of building a to-do list (full of tasks) manually every single day
  - By introducing regular check-ins, and new inbox folders pre filtered to due today, due this week
- Allow tasks to be attached to regular check-ins - this ensured that when a member was called, the care team knew what to talk about and took advantage of the phone call and member's time.
- We also focused on making the landing page - 360 view - more useful for users
- We removed many widgets from this page, and added a bunch of new ones. We collected feedback, iterated until we got to a good place. One example: I removed the entire Care TEam from the widget in favor of just the Primary of the member. This made it hard for Care Teams to coordinate with one another so I added some of teams widget back. Another example: we tried to add all of the tasks due for a member right to the 360 view thinking this would help users figure out what to discuss when on the phone with a member. The list was too long and we kept getting requests for more and more data to be added to the tasks here that eventually it just became clear the users needed to see everything and therefore they should just go to the Care Plan - where these tasks lived with care plan goals and workflows - instead of trying to summarize on the landing 360 view page.
