Ways of Working


BCD is focused on 4 strategic themes this year that we’ll bring to any work we do with Execution Excellence or Strategic Solutions partners

Engagement strategy, insights and experiments that change the course of in year engagement performance.
What if every successful experiment scaled within the year?
Enabling care teams to earn member satisfaction in every interaction.
What if our systems defaulted users to the micro-behaviors that 
drive satisfaction?
Reducing low value decisions and enable focus.
What if it was easy to deliver the right experience to members while making the most of care teams’ and members’ time?
Making care team collaboration easy.
What if closing the loop between a CHP and RN was as easy as tapping someone on the shoulder?

2025 ENGAGEMENT THEME

Spotlight updates

In partnership with MX and Population Health we’ll run a randomized experiment on whether a high “dose” of engagement texts can drive Rx adherence

SPOTLIGHT #1 | Rx Adherence SMS Pilot
For more information contact @Lily O, @Ben B and @Gabrielle N
Hypothesis: A high “dose” program of scaled SMS messages focused on root cause behavioral drivers of non-adherence that is sent in between live Cityblock visits can support members in better medication adherence for cholesterol, diabetes and hypertension RXs and lower total cost of care. Full experiment proposal here.
Cityblock #RxTip: A small decrease in your A1C sugar levels can reduce your risk of diabetes complications, like vision loss and kidney disease, by nearly 50%. Taking medications regularly is important for keeping your sugar levels under control. Call Cityblock at 833-904-2273 to learn more or ask questions.
DIABETES
Cityblock #RxTip: Cityblock can help you explore options to lower the cost of cholesterol medications with generics, cash discount cards, co-pay support programs, and more. Call Cityblock at 833-904-2273 to get started.

                   A lot of times we’ll just 
have the wrong numbers or disconnected numbers or we don’t know what number it is… not uncommon that we have four or     
     five plus phone numbers for a member

SPOTLIGHT #2 | TOC Activation Discovery
Context
The barriers in our TOC Activation research align with regular activation but are often amplified by tighter compliance timelines and strong emotions during critical health events

SPOTLIGHT #3 | Intelligent Prioritization and Loop Closure PT1
For more information contact @Efrain Calderon or @Jesse Trippe
Iterative learning helped determine what to add and optimize and what to remove: Opportunity engine discovery > 5 user concept testing > 25 user design pilot
After
Before
80% of users interviewed ignored the contents of the 360 view. 50% of users requested widgets that already existed on the page but were buried
Only 20% of users scrolled as far as needed to find Opportunities widget at the bottom of the screen
Brought Opportunities to top of the page to make call 
priorities salient
Gave TOC/MIC workflows higher visibility since 100% of users interviewed studied the timeline for these events
Consolidated Member Impressions to initial assessment based on where users found value

Other Info
Early opportunity engine discovery
Finding
Users consistently organize their days across urgent tasks (TOC/MIC), outbound comms (callbacks), and regular check-ins. 

We saw a lot of competing information on member profiles and the home page that distracted users. 
FeatureWe aligned the Commons inbox to users’ mental models of their workday to make it flow by adding ‘Due today’ and ‘Due this week’ Inbox folders.

We removed the acuity spider-chart and other widgets and condensed the Team and Member Impressions widgets. 
SPOTLIGHT #3 | Intelligent Prioritization and Loop Closure PT2
Examples of the discovery, feedback and testing channels we used and the changes they catalyzed
Concept testing with five users
Finding
When we shared mockups of these changes, users were excited not to manually build their day’s priorities. 

User questioned whether the 360 view would be adequate to complete regular check-ins. 
FeatureHaving validated the most significant Inbox changes and features, we tweaked the 360 view to respond to user comments  (e.g. by bringing back PCP attribution info, Acuity label - no chart - for P32). 
Pre-pilot with 25 users across mkts before launch
FindingUsers responded overwhelmingly positively to Inbox changes, and identified three bugs to address (biggest bug: regular check-in code was bringing in more than just regular check-ins, to-do list + calendar UI got all messed up, scrolling in the regular check-in folder was not working).

FeatureUser feedback validated the initial Inbox features, and we addressed bugs identified. (Pre-pilot users still have the new features and use them daily.)

From here, we outlined the hypotheses and associated metrics to test against in our 3/3 Ways of Working pilot launch. Expect evaluation data in the next update!

SPOTLIGHT #4 | Zus Implementation
For more information contact @tiffanyton
Next steps
Conduct post-launch user interviews to shadow and understand how our users are interacting with Zus in Commons and Athena to help us identify pain points and user sentiment to influence our next iteration and guide necessary improvements.
Potentially joining forces with IPLC team for further design and workflow integrations. 
                Good Afternoon, 
just wanted to say I am really loving Zus. Thank you all so much for your hard work with transitioning into this platform!
“
-Risk adjustment associate
Only 32% of users in the Q4 Voice of the User survey found chart prep easy. We hypothesize the new Zus integration makes this easier while simplifying other use cases too.
6 of 7 interviewees went to the Health Gorilla site and manually searched for the member’s chart by copying the member’s name from Commons and pasting it into Health Gorilla’s search bar. So we added Zus directly to the member profile nav bar for easy access.
7 out 7 interviewees used Health Gorilla daily (with 3 reporting 20x a day!); adding the data directly into Commons makes it easy to find and reduces steps

Next steps:
Review key findings during T2 planning and incorporate any high impact potential improvements that support improved, compliant communications about members  in product and operational programs

SPOTLIGHT #5 | Voice-Of-The-User: Collaboration Analysis
For more information contact @meganz and @rachel.banay
Where we started:
In our Q4 ‘24 Voice of the User pulse, arranging care with another member of the care team and closing the loop on a member’s needs emerged as frontline pain points. Removal of PHI from Slack makes this collaboration more difficult.
The top barrier to sharing information with colleagues was working across many platforms (38%)
Users found taking the next step on an open quality gap difficult (42%) due to not knowing what the next step should be or who should take it
         Providers use Athena, most of the care team uses Commons. [with] too many programs, miscommunications can happen.
“
Only 43% of users completely trust other members of the Cityblock team who support member care, likely due to less visibility
           I've become hesitant to even wager a guess regarding when the care team will reach out or connect the patient with appropriate resources.
Resolving product & process barriers to care team collaboration can help meet Product goals of a 10% increase in ease of user impact in 2025
What we did:
Analyzed 145 users who answered relevant survey questions to investigate granular barriers to collaboration, information sharing, and loop closure  
What we found:
Users report product and operational barriers to 
effective collaboration. Full analysis available here.

1 Calculation for 100 hours monthly savings: The PRD states Cityblock staff complete an average of 593 case conferences/month. At 15 minutes prep time per conference, this equals 148.25 hours monthly. If AI reduces prep time to 5 minutes per conference, teams would spend 49.4 hours monthly, saving 98.85 hours (rounded to 100 hours) company-wide.
Discovery reinforces that preparing for case conferences 
is time consuming…
…while revealing that the opportunity for impact is bigger than preparation time savings alone
Users have appetite to use AI summarization for more use cases.
Users spot opportunities to use AI to assign tasks and skip case conference.
A NC TOC nurse reported spending up to 3 hours prepping for a complex new member's case conference, searching for scattered information across multiple sources.
                     Maybe AI could 
      automatically assign that 
[the task] to the nurse instead 
of it going to case conference for
the CHP to discuss it… that [issue with the member] doesn't need to go to case conference at all.

Solving at ScaleFramework for setting cross-functional strategy, building together and scaling experiences at Cityblock

This emerging framework, born from collaboration across BCD, ODD, Product, Integrated Care Design and other functions, aligns our approach to problem discovery and solution implementation. It fosters scalable, cross-functional experiences that are as effective in practice as they are in planning.
While there is additional cross functional work underway to create tools and assets to support this framework, the BCD team has started using this framework to categorize our work. Click here for the expanded version.Please note the following team portfolio slide is organized by this framework.
