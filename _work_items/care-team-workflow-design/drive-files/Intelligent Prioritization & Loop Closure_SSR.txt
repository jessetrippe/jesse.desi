Preparation for National Scale

Based on Early Adoption Feedback, We Made the Following Enhancements
11
Proprietary & Confidential  

Added “primary contact filter” to RCI inbox to allow teams to filter to each others’ inboxes, enabling out-of-office coverage and manager visibility
Introduced capability for teams to delay RCI by 1 week if member asks for a callback after due date, as well as skip RCI for 1 cycle if member is known to be unavailable (e.g., out of country, incarcerated)
Added week-over-week view to RCI performance metrics, in addition to panel view
[coming soon] Introduced workflow to remove disengaged members from LCT panels and conduct prioritized re-engagement efforts

Set default page to Inbox
Added RCI icon to due date in inbox
Made it easier to set task priority level
Removed task widget from 360
Added ability to assign tasks to primary in bulk uploader
Filter “on hold” RCIs out of inbox
Added back entire Care Team to 360 Teams widget

Expanded templates that “count” for RCI to include MA ICT meetings
Introduced “on hold” status for RCIs with due dates during TOC readmission mitigation and when members are pending disenrollment
Updated logic to allow users to document interactions until 11:30pm the following day
Updated P32 acuity cadence

What’s Next

What’s Next: Leveraging the Prioritization Chassis
15
Proprietary & Confidential  
Today, the Regular Check-in Inbox drives cadenced proactive outreach to members based on assigned track. However, this is configurable to accommodate changes to any underlying variables, including:
Prioritization signal (e.g., P32 acuity, impactable opportunities)
Outreach cadence (e.g., 14 days for most high-need members; annual outreach for low risk gap closure)
Reason for outreach (e.g., re-engagement of highest impactable disengaged members, gap closure in low-risk program)

Teams are managed against (1) attempted outreach on time and (2) success rates, regardless of how prioritization is set on the back end.
Snippet from Care Team Ways of Working training
In T1, we pulled scattered signals into a single screen on the 360 page to highlight open quality gaps and program eligibility alongside member tasks. 

In T2, we will build on this foundation to (1) recommend the most important opportunities for each member and (2) suggest the right action on each opportunity, specific to the care team member’s role and licensure.

Early Lessons from 
Early Adoption

Care Team Ways of Working Launched 3/3 🎉
21
Proprietary & Confidential  
Care Team Ways of Working launched in our “early adopter” markets (IN MDwise, MA P32, and MA SWH) on Monday, March 3.
Successes to celebrate:
We made decisions and stuck to them🔒
The workgroup moved quickly and decisively. We locked decisions through SBARs and COAs, including:
Bundle work into comprehensive interactions (recap)
Use tasking to surface work to care teams and invest in tasking (recap)
Define “difficult to reach” (COA)
Shift calendar due dates to business days (SBAR)
IOS and operational implementation (COA, SBAR)
Accountability for disengaged member re-engagement (COA)
We were focused, which allowed us to be fast 👟
We kicked off this work on December 9, completed problem elaboration and locked requirements on January 15, and started building on January 30. In order to pull this off, we had fully dedicated:
2 Product Managers
7 Engineers
2 Product Designers
3.5 ODD Team Members (2 fully dedicated, 3 partly dedicated)

In addition to the above, our workgroup included significant effort from: BCD, R&A, ICD, Quality, Nursing & Social Care, MX, and market stakeholders.
Training and launch support was well-received 🪲
Care team feedback has been very positive overall. Highlights include:
Successful 2-day in-person training in IN. Most people prefer in-person (64%) and trainers were better able to identify knowledge gaps.
Stellar engagement from IN and MA in support channel and office hours.
Product and engineering resolved all bugs in 48h or less and have been highly responsive to user feedback.

Training survey results here.
“This is one of the smoothest launches i have experienced at Cityblock” - CHP
“I feel so much more organized” -CHP
“This is great! Finally I don't need to swim through tasks to figure out my day. Love it.” - RNCM
“I loved that the team was able to be personable and connect with one another while learning something new and a safe space to react in real time was essential” -anonymous survey response

“Care Team Ways of Working” Encompassed IPLC Strategic Solutions

Proprietary & Confidential  
Redesigned 360
Comprehensive Member Interactions
Care teams are engaging members through multiple, disconnected outreach efforts that are (1) inefficient at advancing progress on open opportunities (e.g., quality gaps) and (2) less effective at addressing members’ needs.
Business Problem
Care teams do not have unified guidance or prompts on which member should be engaged next in their day-to-day operations.
Prioritized Panel Management
We do not currently have a way to connect identified member needs to action taken to address that need and/or loop closure of that need in our documentation or data.
Loop Closure & Follow Through
Our frontline staff, and their managers, do not have clear responsibilities and performance expectations. Productivity expectations for care teams are not integrated in panel management or cadenced proactive outreach expectations.

A pilot allows us to test our hypotheses, build confidence for scale and change course when necessary
Why run a pilot? To ensure the changes we’re making have the intended positive effects. A pilot lets us check those effects in an evidence based way

What data will we collect? For each new feature or solution, we’ll gather quantitative data to test hypotheses about whether those solutions make users’ jobs easier, more efficient and effective

We’ll supplement quantitative data with qualitative overlay (from user feedback, surveys) to deepen our impact and operational learnings

How will we use the data? Where quantitative data and user feedback show positive effects associated with new features and solutions, we will make any final adjustments and proceed with implementation

Where the data show no change or even unintended adverse consequences, we’ll pause, diagnose, and redesign

Where and when will we pilot?

ODD, Product, and BCD are reviewing feedback to categorize and prioritize enhancements for national scale. Below is a preview of early thinking; however, no prioritization decisions have been finalized at this time.
Regretless “Quick Wins” to 
Ease User Experience
High Impact, High Priority Enhancements
More Data or Problem Elaboration Needed
Incorporate “not right now” functionality to delay a RCI when member is known to be unavailable
Update logic to “count” an RCI if user retrospectively edits note template used for documenting interaction
[in progress] Provide manager visibility into RCI feed in Commons and enable teams to cover for each other when OOO
Surface date and time of last unsuccessful outreach in RCI folder
Require task due date in Commons
Allow task priority level to be edited without opening the task
Add (1) welcome activities, (2) assessments and screeners, and (3) social care needs to the 360, with tasking support
Implement standard Chart Review as part of CTL quality assurance
Embed automated empanelment tooling in Commons
Build additional workflow flexibility to allow for “checklist” approach and non-linear branching
Build pendo guides and standard videos for 360 and inbox
Add other contextual information to 360
Indicate “top reason” we’re prioritizing a member for outreach
Continue refining 360 view to ensure every widget is useful
Explore priming members prior to RCI due date
Leverage AI summarization for pre-call planning
Integrate IOS into track and cadence recommendations
Automatically generate tasks based on open BOI or Quality gaps

Planning for National Scale

Proprietary & Confidential  
Our most frequent piece of constructive criticism on Early Adopter launch was that stakeholders felt crunched for time. In response, we are:
Kicking off market-specific launch discussions this week and next week
Incorporating demos of new tooling in staging prior to training and launch
Pulling Quality Foundations training into its own session, prior to Ways of Working
Identifying market champions earlier to understand new tooling and meet with early adopter markets

Tentative Launch Plan (to be confirmed with markets)
Ohio: Training Apr 23-25; Launch Apr 28
New York & Florida: Training Apr 28; Launch May 1
North Carolina: Training May 6-7; Launch May 8

Comprehensive Member Interactions: Overview
Problem Statement
Care teams are engaging members through multiple, disconnected outreach efforts that are (1) inefficient at advancing progress on open opportunities (e.g., quality gaps) and (2) less effective at addressing members’ needs.  This results in increased cost to the organization and inefficient use of our members’ time.
Definition of Success
Outreach within and across care teams is efficient and coordinated. Each successful connection resolves multiple member needs in a single interaction, driving value for member and advancing progress on open opportunities while more efficiently utilizing care team and member time.

Loop Closure & Follow Through: Overview
Problem Statement
We do not currently have a way to connect identified member needs to action taken to address that need and/or loop closure of that need in our documentation or data.
Definition of Success
Cityblock can measurably show loop closure and manage teams against follow-through on member needs.

Operationalizing Care Team Expectations: Overview
Problem Statement

Across markets, our frontline staff and their managers do not have standard responsibilities and performance expectations. These inconsistencies lead to misaligned performance expectations and hinders the integration of productivity goals within panel management and proactive outreach workflows.
Definition of Success

Develop and roll out standardized roles, responsibilities, and productivity expectations for CHPs and RNCMs. Productivity expectations are aligned with panel management and proactive outreach workflows.

Program Updates

Comprehensive Member Interactions: Overview
Problem Statement
Care teams are engaging members through multiple, disconnected outreach efforts that are (1) inefficient at advancing progress on open opportunities (e.g., quality gaps) and (2) less effective at addressing members’ needs.  This results in increased cost to the organization and inefficient use of our members’ time.
Definition of Success
Outreach within and across care teams is efficient and coordinated. Each successful connection resolves multiple member needs in a single interaction, driving value for member and advancing progress on open opportunities while more efficiently utilizing care team and member time.

Care Pathways: Overview
Problem Statement
Cityblock does not have a structured approach to deliver high-value care to manage members’ conditions, associated with impactable member health and condition-specific spend. 
Definition of Success
Care teams can navigate through condition specific Care Pathways for members, coordinating across roles within a shared structure to deliver consistent evidence-based care expected to improve health outcomes, reduce avoidable ED/IP visits, and close associated quality gaps.

Prioritized Panel Management: Overview
Problem Statement
Care teams do not have unified guidance or prompts on which member should be engaged next in their day-to-day operations.  Current push factors include cadenced outreach, market chase lists, signal-based proactive outreach, and follow-through on member commitments; however, these can conflict with each other and have not been integrated into unified expectations.
Definition of Success
Care teams maximize their effectiveness each day by focusing engagement efforts on the right member based on the appropriate cadence, impactability, and need.

Risk-Stratified TOC Workflows: Overview
Problem Statement
We currently trigger high- vs. low-intensity workflows based on segmentation. However, the likelihood to readmit (LTR) score is a better predictor of readmission and is more applicable to the members who have HIE events.
Definition of Success
All markets are auto-triggering workflow intensity based on LTR, with fewer than 20% of workflows getting canceled and changed due to inappropriate intensity

We are in-progress with working through resourcing for the remaining features targeted for our National go live in May.
MVP Go Live (3/3)
Regular Check-in & Task Pinning (R) -  The Care Optimization & Scale (COS) and Practice Management(PM) teams are working as a single team to deliver this work. Given the tight timelines and small margin for error, we will remain in a yellow, at-risk status until delivery.
Archive Tasks (V) - The Member Surface team for the MVP is taking on the work for Archived Tasks for MVP Go live due to capacity constraints of the PM and COS team
National Go Live (4/28)
Task Evidence Linking (T), Automated Tasks Closure (U) and Recurring tasks (S)  are the additional features we would like to make available for our go live in May. 
The PM team needs 1 established CBH eng be added to the PM team by early March in order to deliver these features for May.

Yesterday, held a requirement review meeting with Market Sponsors, Business Owners, and SMEs
64
Proprietary & Confidential  
Deck available here
Approval step associated with Step 3: Ideation & Concept Development
Focused on requirements identified to address prioritized business problems; not the actual design of solution itself.
In order to pilot an MVP in March, we are proposing that this group reviews a demo as part of Build Approval to allow work group more time to align on draft solutions.
Approval Request: Are these the minimum set of requirements that must be met in order to successfully address business problems and launch in markets?
Outcome: No red flags were identified. Discussion revealed good alignment between requirements proposed and stakeholder needs.
What’s Next: Assuming we get approvals by Friday, product team to demo an MVP solution. Anticipating resourcing and trade off conversations to come.

Operationalizing the Impactable Opportunity Score (IOS)
65
Proprietary & Confidential  
What is the IOS?

The IOS is a score that integrates 5 opportunity types into a single weighted value (listed below).
Every member is assigned an IOS, which updates daily.
Member lists can be ranked by the aggregate IOS, as well as by individual opportunity types within the IOS.

IOS = Adjunct Revenue + TCOC Reduction Potential

MVP Included Opportunity Types

Adjunct Revenue
Quality
BOI gaps
TCOC Reduction Potential
Care pathways and clinical programs
TOC readmission reduction (LTR score)
MIC ED/IP diversions
The IOS does not incorporate operational variables, such as:
Member status (e.g., activated, pre-activated)
Member engagement data (e.g., quality of contact data, last attempted interaction date, last successful interaction date, hard-to-reach status)
Tasks due (e.g., MIC handoff tasks, care plan progress, inbound comms loop closure)
IOS overview deck available here
Potential Paths for Operationalizing the IOS
Sorting and Filtering on Member Table
In Scope: T1
The new “panel view” will display members ordered by next proactive outreach date. Users will have the ability to re-sort this list by IOS score, as well as filter on individual opportunity types (e.g., open quality gaps).
Prioritize Activated Members for Proactive Outreach
In Scope: T2
Today, proactive outreach is prioritized for members with (1) an urgent MIC or TOC need and (2) for members due for Regular Check-In.

See COA slide (next) for options on how to operationalize.
IOS for Pre-Activated Outreach
In Scope: T2
[Omnichannel Engagement]

IOS Course of Action: Prioritization of Activated Members for Proactive Outreach
66
Proprietary & Confidential  
Benefits:
Dynamically updates with new data daily
Ensure outreach is pointed at highest impactable members only
Easier to “put finger on scale” and increase outreach to sub-population
Risks:
Highest score members will always be at the top of list
Removes cadenced outreach, undermining predictability of Cityblock engagement
Removes ability to bundle tasks with next Regular Check-In date
Benefits:
Lowest change management burden on markets
Maintains cadenced outreach model, which has been validated in Trust Index work
Allows bundling of tasks with Regular Check-in date
Increases configurability of Regular Check-in to include (1) thresholds associated with each track and (2) cadence associated with each track
Risks: 
Delays time from data signal to track change
Use IOS to Assign Initial Tracks for Regular Check-in 
(Replacing Segmentation)
Deprecate Regular Check-Ins and Migrate to IOS-Driven Outreach Only
Benefits:
Maintains cadenced outreach model, which has been validated in Trust Index work
Surfaces members with highest impactability score on panel view
Low change management burden on markets
Risks:
Will only see benefit of IOS if we are surfacing an unmanageable number of regular check-ins each day
Lower configurability for Regular Check-in thresholds
Maintain Segmentation for Regular Check-Ins; Introduce IOS to Prioritize Members Within Tracks
Assessment: Explore in the future; we are not organizationally aligned on this use of IOS. Requires more insights and testing.
Assessment: Option eliminated. We are operationally not at a place where we would deprecate regular check-in.
Assessment: Preferred option; easier on-ramp to introduce IOS and continue refining operational approach.
Ratified with Mike, Charisse, Libby, Ruchi

The Day Begins: Who to Engage?
RN CMs and CHPs open Commons to their panel view, where they see lists of members who need action today.
Product Build: Panel View
The “panel view” surfaces the below prioritization signals to help RN CMs and CHPs to decide who to engage next:

Members with appointment scheduled today
Members with task due (urgent tasks at the top)
Members due for proactive outreach 
Connecting with a Member: What to Discuss?
RN CMs and CHPs comprehensively address all aspects of a member’s care appropriate to their scope of practice.
Product Build: Defragmented View
The “defragmented view” surfaces all relevant information (action items & contextual information) needed to effectively prepare for & conduct a comprehensive member interaction

Care pathway eligibility
Program eligibility
Care plan goals and tasks
BOI and Quality gaps
Documentation and System Loop Closure
Following a member interaction, RN CMs and CHPs document their care progress, which automatically updates members queued in the panel view for engagement
Product Build: Loop Closure
Loop closure is how Cityblock monitors that actions surfaced for care teams are completed. This includes both documentation support for care teams to record progress on identified member needs, as well as automatic system identification of completed work.

Loop closure ties together the panel view and the defragmented view. Work identified and completed during a comprehensive interaction impacts when a member will next be queued for engagement.
Performance Management
Frontline managers can zoom into daily, weekly, and monthly RN CM and CHP performance
Analytics  Build: Frontline Manager Visibility
The Frontline Manager Visibility dashboard gives care team managers a comprehensive view into how care teams are performing, and will link out to CHP Productivity View and RN Scorecard (existing dashboards), and CHP Scorecard (to be completed in T1). 
Before we dive into specific requirements, this is an overview of how these pieces all fit together
Loop closure - ties together the work surfaced and the work completed, which then impacts when the member will be prioritized for engagement next (informs panel management)
Performance management - building frontline manager visibility dashboard for view into team performance

Comprehensive Member Interactions: Overview
Problem Statement
Care teams are engaging members through multiple, disconnected outreach efforts that are (1) inefficient at advancing progress on open opportunities (e.g., quality gaps) and (2) less effective at addressing members’ needs.  This results in increased cost to the organization and inefficient use of our members’ time.
Definition of Success
Outreach within and across care teams is efficient and coordinated. Each successful connection resolves multiple member needs in a single interaction, driving value for member and advancing progress on open opportunities while more efficiently utilizing care team and member time.

Tasking Enhancements Scoped
⭐️When possible, reporting will be based in evidence of work, not task completion
⭐️ When evidence is present, tasks are programmatically closed
Every task is limited to a single discrete action item which is either “open” or “complete”
⭐️ Outreach attempts are measured separately from task statuses
⭐️ Tasks include a task category, which can eventually be used for system prioritization
⭐️ Non-urgent task due dates are aligned to next regular check in
⭐️Clear standards defined for urgent, important and regular priority tasks
We can trigger a set of related, non-linear tasks, allowing tasks to reflect more discrete action items and unlocking observability. Decreases complexity and mental burden for care team members
⭐️ Inbox enhancements focus users on tasks due today, instead of on the entire universe of tasks assigned. Tasks can be easily bundled by member and due dates are more organized around regular check-ins
What We’ve Heard

Tasks may be marked “complete” for a variety of reasons (e.g., member declined service, service no longer relevant). Therefore, it is difficult to understand what work was accomplished from tasks.

Marking a task complete is often an additional documentation step beyond the documentation of the work completed (e.g., a med rec in athena).

Multiple actions are nested within single tasks, making it difficult to measure progress.

Task categorization is immature and therefore we are not able to support system prioritization.

Non-urgent task due dates prompt unnecessary outreaches that could have been more efficiently aligned to next regular check in.

Users are overwhelmed by tasks in their inbox.

Care Pathways: Overview
Problem Statement
Cityblock does not have a structured approach to deliver high-value care to manage members’ conditions, associated with impactable member health and condition-specific spend. 
Definition of Success
Care teams can navigate through condition specific Care Pathways for members, coordinating across roles within a shared structure to deliver consistent evidence-based care expected to improve health outcomes, reduce avoidable ED/IP visits, and close associated quality gaps.

Prioritized Panel Management: Overview
Problem Statement
Care teams do not have unified guidance or prompts on which member should be engaged next in their day-to-day operations.  Current push factors include cadenced outreach, market chase lists, signal-based proactive outreach, and follow-through on member commitments; however, these can conflict with each other and have not been integrated into unified expectations.
Definition of Success
Care teams maximize their effectiveness each day by focusing engagement efforts on the right member based on the appropriate cadence, impactability, and need.

Risk-Stratified TOC Workflows: Overview
Problem Statement
We currently trigger high- vs. low-intensity workflows based on segmentation. However, the likelihood to readmit (LTR) score is a better predictor of readmission and is more applicable to the members who have HIE events.

Governance: Introducing Strategic Solutions Review

Overseen by the ELT and OC, in 2025, we will organize to maintain strong management oversight over two distinct, yet highly interrelated, areas:														
Monitoring business performance and making adjustments as needed as it relates to week-by-week execution, towards specific business outcomes 
(e.g., BOI, Quality, Engagement, etc.)

Current state aligned to Q/MBR, MMU
1. Execution Excellence Governance
Managing the products and programs we are working on to launch large scale innovation and new capabilities, in support of our business execution
(e.g., Intelligent Prioritization, Data Effectiveness)

Current state aligned to Business Priority SteerCo’s, PAB
2. Strategic Solutions Governance
While these models are distinct in focus, there will be notable overlap in participants and intentional, iterative solutioning across governance forums as adjustments to our plan are needed.
Distinct, Two-Pronged Approach to Governance
Ruchi

Double Click: Strategic Solutions
Strategic Solutions represent common enabler domains identified in our Critical Enablers exercise that drive toward multiple priority business outcomes 
Goal
Ensure successful development and installation of the programs on the central roadmap aligned to each of the domains on the right. We will use the Solving @ Scale (S@S) framework to manage program progression and validate they are landing in-market with the intended effect. 
Evolution from Current State
Dedicated space for discussion of program development and deployment in a central forum
Deprecation of individual governance forums (i.e., Business Priority SteerCo’s) in favor a singular model with consistent management and oversight
Full separation of execution from innovation to ensure working teams are solely focused on executing against prioritized work on the roadmap
Use of a consistent framework (S@S) to manage performance across programs
Principles & Ways of Working
Below the central, integrated governing body, each strategic solution will have focused management in place to: (a) ensure solutions materialize into market impact (b) track progress toward optimal impact as the solutions are built and implemented, including when/how they hit markets
Zoe Behr (ODD) and Ruchi Medhekar (Product Management) will have dyadic responsibility across the full roadmap; within a domain, an ODD / PM dyad will have execution responsibility
Given that these domains drive multiple business outcomes, each domain will include senior business leaders as key stakeholders who validate requirements and impact in their respective verticals, and will have accountability for program installation within their vertical; these business leaders are Execution Excellence vertical owners, and serve as the primary customer of their respective SS domain
We will measure defined success criteria and milestones across all initiatives with a Red / Yellow / Green tracking approach (R: 50% chance of landing as define on timeline, Y: 50-80%, G: >80%)

Owners: SS dyad, business owner
1 This process should be used for any initiatives that require cross-functional resourcing that arise between planning cycles. Note: Emergent exceptions (e.g. high priority outages, etc) don't fall into this workflow
2 Dyad+ refers to the Product Manager and their operational counterpart (ODD or other ops)

Talk track:
We know there is important work not on the roadmap that may come up between planning cycles, so we’re introducing a new Central Prioritization Process in order to ensure we’re taking on the most impactful work towards our 2025 goals. This will give us a comprehensive view of all requested work and will allow us to prioritize these requests against the roadmap and against other requests.
The process:
Requests are submitted through Fresh Service or through the new Strategic Solutions intake form which is linked on the slide. These requests will flow into a central Strategic Solutions backlog.
Requests are reviewed by Ruchi/Zoe on a bi-weekly basis and assigned to a SS domain area for review
SS Dyads review assigned requests, look at current priorities and tradeoffs, and provide a go/no go decision on each request
Any requests that are directly related to the roadmap are maintained and adjudicated directly by the dyads+business owner rather than being adjudicated by Ruchi/Zoe
Requests are either added to the roadmap or remain in the backlog
There will be a continuous process with Markets to pull off high priority items from the backlog to work on as part of Quick Hits
Important note: This process does not apply to emergency exceptions which should follow the existing process for reporting and triage (ex. High priority outages)

⭐ Tasking Insights Applicable to Comprehensive Member Interactions and Unified View

We must design with these existing pain points in mind as we introduce new concepts and ways of surfacing work, as to not exacerbate the issues:
Desensitized Urgency
Tasks with due dates should be used for time sensitive things that need to appear in the inbox, otherwise we overload the inbox & desensitize urgency
Clutter / Overwhelm
Tasks not due for a while create a lot of noise and “clog” up the inbox. Users mainly want to see the tasks due this / next week, which they need to focus on
Performance Expectations
Tasks are also member interventions. Care team members will always have a ton of tasks, some of which don’t go away because we are checking in on these things each time we meet with the member. There is no world in which a CHP is able to have an empty inbox, as this would mean they are doing something wrong
Attempted vs. Overdue
Given the dependency on member engagement to complete many member tasks, users need a way to indicate work was attempted but unable to complete if a member wasn’t reached. We lack standard guidance on this & don’t have a way to indicate attempted work in Commons. Varied approaches muddy our task data

Care Pathways: Overview
Problem Statement
Cityblock does not have a structured approach to deliver high-value care to manage members’ conditions, associated with impactable member health and condition-specific spend. 
Definition of Success
Care teams can navigate through condition specific Care Pathways for members, coordinating across roles within a shared structure to deliver consistent evidence-based care expected to improve health outcomes, reduce avoidable ED/IP visits, and close associated quality gaps.

Prioritized Panel Management: Overview
Problem Statement
Care teams do not have unified guidance or prompts on which member should be engaged next in their day-to-day operations.  Current push factors include cadenced outreach, market chase lists, signal-based proactive outreach, and follow-through on member commitments; however, these can conflict with each other and have not been integrated into unified expectations.
Definition of Success
Care teams maximize their effectiveness each day by focusing engagement efforts on the right member based on the appropriate cadence, impactability, and need.

S@S Phase
⭐ Regular Check-In Enhancements Released 12/6
The following enhancements were identified by cross-functional and market stakeholders as (1) solving high-priority pain points with current functionality and (2) feasible for short-term improvement prior to releasing full panel management MVP.
👉 Next Milestone: Problem statement approval by end of week (maybe end of today! 😉)
⭐ Inputs for Prioritized Panel Management
During initial stakeholder conversations, we have identified the following as key inputs into prioritized panel management.
Workflows will be triggered 7 days before the check-in due date
Tasks canceled with the reason “unable to reach” will re-trigger after a successful member interaction
After a TOC handoff, regular check-in workflow will be re-triggered 7 days after TOC completion
Inbound Comms

Members calling into Cityblock should jump to the top of the panel list for action
Tasks Due

Members with a task due today should be actioned on today
Appointments

Care teams should keep the appointments scheduled
Regular Check-In

We should proactively check in with members at an operational cadence based on members’ need (e.g., IOS)
Campaigns

Markets and MX may have short-term sprints (e.g., flu shot campaign) that drive outreach priorities

Risk-Stratified TOC Workflows: Overview
Problem Statement
We currently trigger high- vs. low-intensity workflows based on segmentation. However, the likelihood to readmit (LTR) score is a better predictor of readmission and is more applicable to the members who have HIE events.
Definition of Success
All markets are auto-triggering workflow intensity based on LTR, with fewer than 20% of workflows getting canceled and changed due to inappropriate intensity

Solving at Scale: Collaborating to set cross-functional strategy, build together and scale experiences at Cityblock
PHASE
Solving at Scale helps cross functional teams solve problems together with a focus on progressively building confidence in solutions. Solving at Scale:
is first and foremost based on Cityblock’s First Principles
embraces all functions. It’s not meant for a specific function; it’s a way to work across functions and disciplines
intends to give teams an outline of the most important steps and questions to consider without prescribing an exact formula
assumes cycles between the steps and iteration. Not every solution will make it through every step.
flexes based on the problem at hand. A team could cycle through these steps in days or weeks depending on the complexity of the problem and solution spaces.

Proprietary & Confidential  
The Day Begins: Who to Engage?
RN CMs and CHPs open Commons to their homepage, where they see lists of members who need action today.
Product Build: Panel View
The “panel view” is a revamped version of the current homepage that provides 3 widgets for RN CMs and CHPs to decide who to engage next:

Members with appointment scheduled today
Members with task due (urgent tasks at the top)
Members due for proactive outreach 
Connecting with a Member: What to Discuss?
RN CMs and CHPs comprehensively address all aspects of a member’s care appropriate to their scope of practice.
Product Build: Defragmented View
The “defragmented view” is a revamped version of the current Member 360 that surfaces all relevant information that may be discussed during a member interaction.

Care pathway eligibility
Program eligibility
Care plan goals and tasks
BOI and Quality gaps
Documentation and System Loop Closure
Following a member interaction, RN CMs and CHPs document their care progress, which automatically updates members queued in the panel view for engagement
Product Build: Loop Closure
Loop closure is how Cityblock monitors that actions surfaced for care teams are completed. This includes both documentation support for care teams to record progress on identified member needs, as well as automatic system identification of completed work.

Loop closure ties together the panel view and the defragmented view. Work identified and completed during a comprehensive interaction impacts when a member will next be queued for engagement.
