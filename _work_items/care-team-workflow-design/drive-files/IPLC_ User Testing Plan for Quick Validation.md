[Jesse Trippe](mailto:jesse.trippe@cityblock.com)[Efrain Calderon](mailto:efrain.calderon@cityblock.com)[Rachel Banay](mailto:rachel.banay@cityblock.com)

# Goals

* Validate new features’ usability & effectiveness.  
* Identify user frustrations & feedback.  
* Prioritize immediate improvements.  
* Gather quick wins & pain points before full rollout.


| Timeline |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Phase | Task | Timeframe |
| **Preparation** | Recruit users, create and finalize script, set up surveys | March 4-6 |
| **User Interviews** | Conduct 5-10 quick sessions | March 10-14 |
| **Survey** | Collect feedback from a broader (entire) group | March 10-14 |
| **Analysis & Prioritization** | Synthesize feedback, highlight key takeaways | March 17-18 |
| **Presentation** | Share findings & next steps | March 19 |

# Research Plan

## User Interviews (Primary)

* 30 min sessions.  
* Gorilla Testing Style:  
  * Focus on real-time reactions and top pain points.  
  * One key scenario per feature instead of full walkthroughs.  
  * Ask users: "What’s confusing?", "What’s useful?", "What’s missing?".  
* Participants: 5-10 users (mix of Indiana & Massachusetts, CHPs RNCMs CTLs etc).  
* Recruiting via Slack (Pilot Group and Pilot Channel)

## Quick Pulse Survey

* Short & Simple (3-5 questions).  
* Goal: Gauge sentiment & surface issues at scale.  
* Delivery: Slack, email, or embedded in Commons.  
* Example Questions:  
  * How easy or difficult is it to use the new Commons Inbox updates? (1-5)  
  * How helpful or helpful is the new Member 360 view? (1-5)  
  * What’s the most frustrating part of the changes? (Open-ended)  
  * Any bugs or blockers you’ve encountered? (Yes/No \+ text field)  
  * What would you like to see next?

## Rapid Analysis & Insights

* Prioritization Framework:  
  * Critical Issues (must fix ASAP before full rollout).  
  * Quick Wins (small tweaks that improve experience).  
  * Feature Requests (valuable but not urgent).  
* Speedy Synthesis:  
  * Use a Google Doc to cluster themes.  
  * No full report—just bullet-point insights.

# User Testing Script (30 min)

Goal: Gather quick feedback on usability, pain points, and areas for improvement.

### Opening (5 min)

#### Introduction

* “Thanks for taking the time\! We’re gathering quick feedback on a few new features to see what’s working and what could be improved.”  
* “This isn’t a test of you—it’s a test of the features. Feel free to share any thoughts, even if something is frustrating or confusing.”

#### Warm-up Question:

* “Before we dive in, how do you typically start your day in Commons?” (Sets context)

---

### Task-Based Walkthrough (15 min)

#### Task 1: Regular Check-Ins (MA Users Only)

* Scenario: "Imagine you need to complete a Regular Check-In for a member. Where would you start?"  
* Follow-ups:  
  * "How easy or difficult is it to track Regular Check-In tasks?"  
  * "Is anything different now from how you used to do this?"  
  * “"is there a way to know if a task is a regular check in task or not?"  
  * "Is there anything confusing or missing?"  
  * **To learn:** we’re showing “on hold” and due date both in inbox and 360 page, is it useful to see the due date if on hold? Why?  
  * **To learn:** Do they notice the regular check-in icon? Is it valuable to denote a task as regular check-in or not? What makes a RCI task different from another task in their view?

#### Task 2: Commons Inbox Update

* Scenario: "You need to check your tasks and organize your day. What do you notice in the new Inbox?"  
* Follow-ups:  
  * "Does separating Regular Check-Ins from other tasks help?"  
  * "Is there anything frustrating about the new layout?"  
  * "Would you change anything about this?"  
  * **To learn:** Does separating tasks, RCIs, and RCI tasks make sense (e.g. there’s nowhere to see ALL your work)?  
  * **To learn:** Should RCIs be hidden once two attempts are made regardless of due date? Why or why not?  
  * **To learn:** Is it useful to see 7 days work of RCIs? Is there a better way to limit them (so that “inbox zero” is more achievable)?  
  * **To learn:** Is showing “Due today and 7 days” more useful than “This week (Mon-Sun)”?  
  * 

#### Task 3: Member 360 View

* Scenario: "You need to prepare for an upcoming member interaction. How would you find key information about the member?"  
* Follow-ups:  
  * "What do you like or dislike about the new Member 360?"  
  * "Does anything feel harder to find than before?"  
  * "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"  
  * **To learn:** We’re showing Previous appointment as well as Next appointment. Is it providing value?  
  * **To learn:** We’re showing all upcoming and overdue tasks \- is it providing value? Why or why not?  
  * **To learn:** Would adding cadence (acuity/track \+ number of days) to RCI widget for transparency and clarity? Why or why not?

#### Task 4: Archive Task

* Scenario: “A member refused to work on a task with you. What would you do next?”  
* Follow-ups:  
  * “Is anything different from how you used to do this?”  
  * “What do you think about the archive reasons?”  
  * \[If archive is not mentioned\] “What does the task status “Archive” mean?”

---

### Quick Closing Questions (10 min)

#### Final Thoughts

* “If you could change just one thing about these updates, what would it be?”  
* “Would you say these changes improve your workflow, are neutral to it, or make it hard? On a scale of 1-5, how much do these changes \[improve/make harder\] your workflow?”  
* “Anything else you’d like to share?”

#### Thank You\!

* "Thanks so much\! Your feedback is really valuable and will help shape improvements."
