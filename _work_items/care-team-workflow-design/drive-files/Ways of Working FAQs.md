| \# | Question | Answer | Market |
| :---: | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1** | Should I already see these Commons inbox folders in my Inbox? | Will be live on 3/3\! (will be in staging early week of 2/24) | MA |
| **2** | Should I be making all of my regular check-in attempts on the same day? | Ideally we want to attempt regular check-in outreach prior to the due date and stagger attempts, but you will be coached to have all attempts done by due date | MA |
| **3** | Are emails/texts included in the attempts if a member prefers to be contacted via email? | Any connection that uses a ‘successful’ or ‘unsuccessful’ template will be counted | MA |
| **4** | Will managers have access to these new Commons features? | There will be manager training next week on 2/26 (MA) and 2/27 (IN)\! | MA |
| **5** | If different staff members reach out for a single member \- would this count toward attempts? | Yes \- any staff member can conduct an outreach attempt to a member \- however, the primary care team member will be the one being coached against it | MA |
| **6** | Do all tasks get assigned to primary/starred care team member? | Tasks will still be assigned to the appropriate care team member | MA |
| **7** | Are we still able to manually change who is responsible for the task? | Yep \- you can still re-assign tasks as needed\! | MA |
| **8** | Are we still going to be using the check-in dashboard? | No need \- Regular/Acuity Check-Ins are all managed through the Regular Check-In folder in the Commons Inbox. | MA |
| **9** | Are we still going to see member’s acuity in the 360? | Yes\! | MA |
| **10** | How do we ensure we are not taking other’s credit when completing tasks/bundling? | You should complete any tasks you are able to. Completing those tasks is how YOU get credit for the work. Task assignees are a safety net for work, but anyone on the care team who is able to take action should\!  | MA |
| **11** | Will the members show overdue if you make the two attempts and they can't be reached? | They will not \-  if you made 2 attempts and the due date passes, the member will fall out of that folder and you'll get credit for the "attempts on time" | MA |
| **12** | Do we  get credit for putting the task in progress or only when it’s completed? | For quality gaps \- only when it’s completed | MA |
| **13** | For TOC RNs: They become primary during TOC, sometimes this is for 2 weeks, or 4 weeks. Sometimes it is only for a few days. Will they be auto assigned RCI and bulk tasking, or is this something they will manually have to do, and vice versa at the completion of TOC. Also TOC does not use the RCI template, will the TOC pill still count for the RCI? | If the TOC RN is made the primary during an active TOC, that TOC RN will then see any RCI that is due in their RCI inbox folder. Anytime the primary is updated in Commons this should be the expected behavior. TOC pill will not count for an RCI. During the pilot the user that is the primary should also enter the RCI template as a separate note so that it ‘counts’ for a RCI attempt as well as a TOC interaction. XXX | MA |
| **14** | RRNs don’t do any of these check in calls. Will I still be able to manually adjust my due dates for the tasks I assigned myself? | Yes \- that will not change\! | MA |
| **15** | Is there any way we can get an example of what a research note for the RCI should look like? | The research portion in preparation for a RCI call is embedded within the new RCI template; “Before The Visit”.  | MA |
| **16** | Does the new Unsuccessful Connection template have a space to document what number we called? | XXX | MA |
| **17** | Do I still have to manually update due dates attached to an unsuccessful regular check-in? | For tasks attached to regular check-in you will not have to manually shift these due dates | MA |
| **18** | Will regular check-in task due dates update when acuity gets changed for folks? | Yes \- tasks set for the next regular check-in will follow the regular check-in due date for the member, however that date changes. | MA |
| **19** | Will archiving tasks go against task metrics? | XXX | MA |
| **20** | Goals that don’t get completed until EOY \- should I be completing these at each check-in? | XXX (coming soon?) | MA |
| **21** | Can I update quality opportunities at any time? | Yes \- we recommend entering in a research note to gain credit for your research | MA |
| **22** | Do we get to keep a copy of our 1:1 templates after each meeting? | XXX | MA |
| **23** | Is it RN/CHP responsibility to fill out a scorecard weekly? | Yes \- managers/leads will have their own scorecards to fill out | MA |

| **43** | Where can I find archived tasks for a member? What if i need to open the task again? | Go to the care plan → click on the 3 dots in the upper right corner → click “show all” This will show you all archived and completed tasks and goals.
