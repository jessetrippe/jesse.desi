Introduction to Core Services

Intro to Core Services | Advancing Our Care Model
Why evolve our Care Model? 
Cityblock must evolve to achieve our vision of becoming the leading nationwide provider of tech-enabled value-based healthcare for marginalized  individuals with complex needs. As a maturing company, it’s time to scale our Care Model in a sustainable way. 
What will we achieve?
Improved member experience and outcomes 
Improved care team efficiency and experience 
A sustainable and repeatable model to support long-term growth
SCRIPT:

Why improve our care model now?

At its core, Cityblock is a living, evolving care model. As we mature as an organization, we need to evolve our  care model and show that we can provide top tier care in a repeatable, sustainable way.  
Core Services is the model of care that every member in the company should receive -  it’s the one area that represents physical, mental and social care together and it’s what make Cityblock stand out.

Longitudinal Care
Acute Care
Meeting Members Needs, at the Right Time, with the Right Care via our foundational Cityblock Care Model




SCRIPT:

What is Core Services and what exactly is changing? 

Recalling a key definition that many of us are familiar with, longitudinal care represents the consistent, continuous care of our members over time, as opposed to event-triggered, episodic care. For example: Acute Care events like MIC and TOC. 
Looking at the member’s care journey on this slide, the aspects of this journey are a representation of Core Services.
But Core Services is the approach to coordinate longitudinal member care at the right intensity and frequency. In other words, this care model aims to provide care to members by the right team members, in the right way, at the right times. 
So by combining the care we already provide with the right guidance and member care activities, we’ll have the ability to engage members longitudinally in a meaningful and measurable way. That itself is our longitudinal care strategy. 

So what’s different about the way we’ll provide care in this model?
Well, you’ll still care for members in the great way you have been, but at almost every step of the member journey here, core services will guide care teams in how to best support our members.
And the way we’re doing this is by embedding a set of key activities that Care Teams will do for every member over the course of their care journey with us. The intensity and frequency of those activities will be dictated by member needs, but having a set of activities associated health needs will allow us to provide care in a more repeatable, sustainable way.
Some of the components that will help us structure the care we provide are new tooling in Commons and associated clinical guidance, enabling a more effective team structure
These components  will support Care Team members and allow us to provide meaningful care to members.

It’s worth mentioning that the member activities embedded within Core Services are backed by evidence-based guidelines and based on the idea that if Care Teams conduct the activities at the prescribed cadence, then we can address any changes in health status and deliver appropriate care to our members, in a measurable way.

Intro to Core Services | Member Tracks

Within Commons, members will be assigned to 1 of 3 tracks: intensive, focused, or responsive. Each member track will encompass the same set of activities to initiate for the member, but at a cadence that corresponds to the level of care needed to support their health conditions. Tracks are initially based on segmentation, but if health needs change, Care Teams will have the ability to change the member’s track through defined clinical guidance and Commons workflow.
Focused Track
(suggested by rising risk segmentation)

Goal: manage their day to day health as individuals living with chronic conditions

Highest intensity of care; most frequent rate of contact, assessment and progress follow up




Goal: improve the member’s ability to self-manage their health conditions 

Medium intensity of care; focused on individual conditions to improve member management 



Intensive Track
(suggested by high risk segmentation)

Goal: support secure connections with external resources and focus on preventive health

Lowest intensity of care; outreach to each of these members will be the least frequent, but we will always respond to the member if they reach out to us

Responsive Track
(suggested by low risk segmentation)
SCRIPT:

Core Services is the approach to coordinate longitudinal member care at the right intensity and frequency. In other words, this care model aims to provide care to members by the right team members, in the right way, at the right times. But how we will Care Teams know who needs what and when?

Guidance has been developed for key activities (examples of this include assessment, care planning, minimum contact cadence, etc,). These specific activities will be thoroughly explained in a separate training, launching next month - but in order to understand how activities are being standardized and deployed at the right intensity and frequency, you’ll need to first understand what a Member track is. 

Member track will be available in Commons and tells us the level of intensity of care the member needs and this guidance will vary by track. 
There are 3 tracks - responsive, which is the lowest intensity of care, focused in the middle, and  intensive, which is the highest intensity of care
Tracks are assigned based on member segmentation and in some markets, this may be akin to Acuity, which represents the care team’s judgement of members’ health risks and needs.
If health needs change, Care Team members can request a track change so that the member receives a more appropriate care that matches the intensity and frequency they need. 


Intro to Core Services | Member Tracks

Now, you can find the most relevant information on the member’s Health Summary card

SCRIPT: 

‘The vision’ of Core Services structures teams to support both social AND clinical needs. 

So which roles are involved? For social care needs we have our Member Navigators and Community Health Partner and for clinical needs, we have our RNs. Within this vision of how Core Services, all member tracks, whether responsive, focused, or intensive, will get the clinical and social skills needed to support their care. 
For each track, there will also be a ‘primary’ team member who will be the member’s care plan owner. 
The primary will work with the other complimentary role - and together, both are responsible for managing the member’s care, but the primary will have the ultimate responsibility for making sure that progress is being made toward the member’s optimal health. 
The primary is generally the person who has the most contact with the member, and there may be cases where someone besides the primary has the most member contact, but the primary still has ultimate responsibility for progress. 
Also included in this vision is a sound backup structure in which every RN has a social care team member as backup and vice versa. 
In further trainings next month, we will cover team structure in depth.

Core Services | Optimizing our Care Model
SCRIPT:

Looking at the activities on this slide once more, which we saw in the beginning of this training, we can now better understand that we are committed to delivering each of these Core Services activities to every member. And that member tracks helps guide the intensity level of each of these activities which vary in depth depending on what the member needs.

So let’s start by talking about what you’ll see with Core Services in the next quarter
The goal for Q4 is to increase longitudinal engagement and retention in high and rising risk members
Right now, and the reason for this training, is to support this goal and focus on enabling you as a Care Team member to have a standard way to interact with our members longitudinally. 
We’re great at engaging members up front, but we needed a standard, more sustainable way in which we manage members in the long term.
So what we’re focusing on to do this is… (next slide)



Foundations to enable Core Services
Market Support
where needed
Product Tools 
+ associated clinical guidance
Standard JDs to provide role clarity
Team Configuration to structure a more collaborative multidisciplinary team
Balanced Caseloads to ensure equitable member access to social & physical care
Assigned ‘Primary’ to ensure clear line of sight for accountability
Member Tracks
Automated Workflow and Templates for Connections
Future State: More tools to come!
Foundations!
To ensure that markets will have a level of readiness to take in the new Core Services elements, we have laid some of the groundwork to assist Care Teams in providing care to our members.

SCRIPT:

Messaging for ‘Market Support’: tie in wording ‘what we’ve done thus far in market’s…’
(No need to go into each of the market infrastructure pieces. This is a very FYI slide to flash up and say: this is the background / we've been prepping for in markets where needed to ensure we can enable Core Services. More to come and later in this training we will talk through some of the Care Team activities for members based on these members tracks that you can expect to see in 2024.)

Member Tracks

To enable care, we use data signals (e.g., predictive analytics, algorithms) as a starting point for planning care and apply clinical judgement (paired with assessments, screenings, and member interactions) to determine the best course of action.
Member Tracks Incorporates Data Signals and Clinical Judgement
The “Best Guess” Data Signal 


Member Segmentation as a data signal, is an algorithm* which leverages claims data to predict members’ health risk: low, rising, high.
Clinical Judgement & Validation

Care team members apply clinical and professional judgment to validate, dispel, or supplement initial algorithm assessment on risk.
Ultimate Determination on Track











Care team determines members’ track by matching their needs to the appropriate care intensity level: responsive, focused, intensive. 

The default Core Services Track will be aligned with Member Segmentation, but if health needs change, Care Teams will have the ability to change the member’s track through defined clinical guidance and Commons workflow.
SCRIPT:

How do we make the ultimate determination on a member track? [will double click into this info in upcoming slides]
Data signals, based on claims data, will provide the initial starting point for care planning. 
Clinical judgement (will have the guidance / workflow in place to request a track change if needed)
Segmentation is our initial guess at member track, based on claims data available
Default track assignments will be set to match segmentation 1:1 
Pre-Consented member tracks will update as segmentation refreshes monthly

Segmentation & Track
Low = Responsive
Rising = Focused
Unassigned = Focused**** call out
High = Intensive

Core services tracks are a byproduct of a data signal and clinical judgement and validation 
You know what your member needs - apply clinical expertise to tracks. Highlight clinical judgement piece and ability to apply. 

"For markets that use acuity, the concept is quite similar in enabling clinicians to apply their judgements on member's health risk”


Member Tracks | All Members will be assigned a default track in Commons
SCRIPT:

Review of where CTMs can see member track
Note that segment and other important indicators can be seen on the health summary card as well


Member Tracks | Care team members can request a 
track change
As CHP/RNs start working with a member, they may learn additional information about the member via assessments, member discussion, etc. that may inform member track assignment.

If a care team member thinks a member track change is appropriate, they will be able to request a track change via a new tool
Commons Reasons for Track Change

More/Less frequent contact cadence
Need clinical license or staff with social care expertise as Point Person
Requiring more/less PCP visits 
Change in eligibility for a CBH program (e.g., Advanced BH or Pregnancy

See Track Change Request Workflow & Guidance for more detail.
SCRIPT:

Through member interactions, Care Team members learn information about a member that may warrant more (or less) intensity and frequency of care - so a track change request can be submitted in Commons to kickstart this change.
Reasons for a track change can include:
The member needing more or less frequent contact
Needing a staff member with a clinical license or staff member with social care expertise to be the Primary
The member is requiring more or less PCP visits 
The member’s eligibility for a CBH program has changed

For any track changes, we have developed guidance that also includes how often a track can be changed. 

Member Tracks | Movement Guidance
Guiding Principles
Track changes can occur at any time in the member journey for the right reasons, which may include:
Change in health risk requiring (a) more/less frequent contact cadence, (b) warranting clinical license or staff with social care expertise as Point Person, or (c) requiring more/less PCP visits (d) change in eligibility for a CBH program like Advanced BH or Pregnancy
Ideally track reassignments are undertaken thoughtfully, resulting in the minimum reassignments required for best care
Members will always have track, and do not graduate from tracks unless disenrolled from Cityblock
Members can only be in 1 track at a time

Workflow
Longitudinal Care Team Member identifies need for track change identified
2. Care Team Lead reviews track change request for clinical and operational appropriateness request and approves 
3. Longitudinal Care Team Member completes hand-off note is completed to ensure safe transition of member
SCRIPT:

To ensure the best member experience, tracks are not intended to be reactive and rapidly changing and should change for the right reasons, which we reviewed on the slide prior and are listed again here.
The process for track changes should also be done with consensus from the team and approval from the Care Team Lead. These team-decisions can be done async, in case conference, or in any other appropriate forums. So once the need is identified, the Care Team member can use the track change request tool to submit a request. The CTL will review the request and if it gets approved and care team members or the primary needs to change, coordinating will occur between both teams to ensure a safe member transition. 
It’s also important to know that:
Members will always have track, and don’t graduate from tracks - unless they are disenrolled from Cityblock
And that members can only be in 1 track at a time

Member Tracks | Track Change Request Workflow 
SCRIPT:

Identification of track in Commons
Step by step walkthrough of track change request WF (note in voiceover to refer back to clinical guidelines to assess appropriateness to change track)
Touch on what happens after request is submitted before moving on to CTL workflow [next slide]

Member Tracks | CTLs must review and approve track change requests 
Once a track change request is submitted by the care team member, the CTL must review & approve the request and make changes in the system. CTL approval is required given track changes may require care team changes (if a member moves between responsive and focused/intensive tracks)



Track change request triggers a workflow for CTL
[if approved] CTL changes track 
[if appropriate] CTL makes care team changes & initiates member transition process
Commons Reasons for Track Change

More/Less frequent contact cadence
Need clinical license or staff with social care expertise as Point Person
Requiring more/less PCP visits 
Change in eligibility for a CBH program (e.g., Advanced BH or Pregnancy

See CTL track change workflow for more detail.
SCRIPT: based on 10/17 revision to Locked Workflow Template

A Care Team Lead will assess the request and approve or cancel the track change request. If approved, the CTL Care Team Lead will  make the necessary track change in the system and coordinate with the new care when warranted. 
Care Team coordination may be needed if a member moved from responsive to focused or intensive or vice versa, due to the different in the primary team member coordinating that member’s care. 
So let’s see what this workflow looks like for the CTL.





Member Tracks | CTL Approval Workflow
SCRIPT: based on 10/17 revision to Locked Workflow Template

Let’s take a look at the CTL workflow for actioning a track change. This information will be important for other Care Team members as well as they play a part in this process. 
So once a track change request is submitted, a CTL can go into the request and either change the member track as requested or cancel the workflow. We’ll look at both scenarios.
In your inbox, the member track change request can be found in their respective queue. 
Click into the queue and you’ll be able to see the requests that have come in.
Filter for your market or pod as needed and locate the member whose track you want to review
in this case I’ll choose one at random since this is the staging environment and there are some repeats - 
You can add it to your to-do and you’ll need to assign yourself to the member task if you aren’t already. 

So clicking into member track change request, you’ll now see that the instructions for completion or cancellation - and the actual track change request and supporting information can be found here.
Click into the track change request and review the rationale for track change. Refer back to the clinical guidance for track change as needed- which will be linked in this training.
After reviewing the request, review the members chart, or any other important information before actioning or canceling the request.
If you agree with the track change and the member will be moving to a new primary care team member or to a different care team, you’ll first task the care team member who submitted the request to complete a member handoff note in the member timeline. 
This handoff note is a safety mechanism to ensure that any new care team members who will be working with that member have all the information they may need to facilitate care. 
Creating the task, we recommend you title the task: “Complete member handoff note” so it’s clear to the care team member what they need to action.. You can add information as needed to support this task - COPY PASTE  I intend to approve this track change, can you please put in a handoff note
The Care Team member will action the task by adding a member handoff note to the member’s timeline. You can find the template here and a set of pre-populated questions will be appear for you to answer. Ensure that you tag your CTL in the note so they have visibility that this action was completed. I won’t be formally publishing this nore as all fields have to be completed, but for a real member, just make sure that everything is filled out before publishing. 
Once the CTL reviews the handoff note and confirms that there will be a safe member handoff, the CTL will then action the track change. 
To do this, you’ll click into the health summary card and scroll down to click on the ‘manage’ button.
Fill out this initial section, assigning a new track and reason for the change - and you can add notes as needed
If no changes in care team are needed, you can skip through steps 2 and 3 to action the track change. Since this member is moving from an intensive to focus tracked, the care team members should remain the same. If a member is moving to the responsive track, which is the lowest intensity track, care team members may change, including the primary for the member’s care.
In this case, you’ll fill out steps 2 and 3 before making the track change. 
Since this member does not need a change in care team, we will just action the track change.
Once the track has been changed, it will immediately show for the member.
After this step, you can now go back into the queue and mark the task as complete.
In the other scenario where you chose to cancel the workflow instead of making the track change, go into your workflow manager and cancel the workflow using the reason that the request was denied.
***Keep in mind that you can refer back to clinical guidelines here as well and this guidance and additional workflow information will also be available with this presentation at the end of this training.

SCRIPT:

At this time, we are aiming to implement these key activities for Core Services in the next few months. For all members, we are about to launch member track, and as we discussed in this training, is going to be assigned by default to match segmentation.
In the next few months, you’ll see a few activities be structured for each member, based on their track. These activities include empanelment, where members will be assigned to their primary based on track, and minimum contact cadence for members which provides the guidance for Care Team members on the frequency of interactions with members. 
Remember that even though members may be on different tracks, Care Teams will deliver the same activities to each and every member, just at a different intensity and frequency. Further training will be provided on these additional activities in the coming months.

Cityblock’s multidisciplinary primary, behavioral, and acute care staff layer on support to the care delivered by the foundational Core Team.
RNs and CHPs work together across a shared group of members to ensure members are longitudinally connected to Cityblock’s core services and are making progress on their unique Care Plans.

Primary for Care | Care Plan Accountability

The Primary for care is accountable for making sure that progress is being made toward the member’s optimal health.  The primary does this by creating a well crafted Care Plan and then creating responsibility within the team for progress on the Care Plan.  


The Primary may be the one with the most member contact in some cases, but not others. Contact with the member should be the most frequent with whatever staff is most likely to create progress on the Care Plan, which COULD be the primary but could also be the other member of the dyad.

What types of interprofessional collaboration do we use at Cityblock?
Task Shifting is when one party shifts one of their tasks to another party, for the sake of team efficiency & expertise   
Task Sharing is when a task is completed collaboratively through efforts of two or more parties 
Consultation is when one party asks for the professional advice of another party of differing (or greater) experience without transfer of any responsibility for care

Referral is when one party asks a specialized party to take on a specific part of member care  in line with that specialty

Cross Coverage is when a task normally performed by Party A is requested to be performed by Party B because Party A is unable to perform the task (e.g., PTO, injury, incomplete training) 

Team Structure | RN-CHP Collaboration



Non-urgent
not urgent, but represents a new piece of information expected to be helpful to team mate(s)
Urgent
 if not addressed within the calendar day, will have a negative impact
Emergent
if not immediately addressed will have a profound negative impact
Example: Slurred speech, severe headache, or new focal weakness 

Action: Call 911, perform CPR if necessary/as able. After transfer to higher level of care, document fully, notify  team members, and notify PCP.
Example: Member reports less than two days of medication and/or reports lack of medication will drive them to the ED

Action: Help member access  Clinical Longitudinal Care Team and/or Virtual Urgent Care
Example: Member says they have questions for their nurse or provider

Action: task or schedule to requested clinical party with appropriate detail of the request

Follow-Up & Close the Loop
Update Care Plan as needed based on the encounter
Set tasks for self and/or others




Regular Check-In | Documentation Template


Prep:

This is where you can take notes on your chart review to prep for contacting your member.

If you are not able to contact your member on the first try, complete your note as “I attempted to call.” 

For each remaining call attempt, create a new note. You can copy/paste your prep notes from your previous attempt. 

Regular Check-In

These are the key questions that we use to drive member towards optimal health

This structure shifts the template away from collecting data towards identifying best actions through targeted questioning
Post-Call Work

Licensed provider (NP/PA/MD) conducts a video or telephonic visit with the member, triaging or resolving the concern

If the issue requires in-person care, the provider will dispatch an Advanced Community Care Clinician (“AC3”, paramedic certified)

Advanced Community Care Clinician and synchronous virtual provider assess and treat the member (see clinical capabilities below)

Providers document in the EHR (Athena), completes  acute care encounter log (ACEL) and hands off follow-up care to the member’s longitudinal care team

MIC Handoff to LCT Team 
MIC Urgent care visits are a crucial component of Cityblock’s care model, ensuring that we provide our members with the right care at the right time. Equally important is the follow-up with our members after these visits, as it's a vulnerable time for them. Supporting their needs during this time fosters trust and reinforces their decision to choose Cityblock over the emergency department. This is why it is  important that we continue to improve our handoffs processes between MIC teams and Longitudinal care teams!

What we have heard from teams about current state processes:
Lack of clarity on expectations for how MIC wants longitudinal care teams to support members post-MIC urgent care
Lack of lack of visibility, current reporting doesn't allow us to understand when expectations set by MIC providers were met or not


MIC Urgent Care Handoff Workflow |  Project Background
Cityblock has gathered an interdisciplinary workgroup to solution around some of the MIC Urgent Care handoff pain points. Cityblock seeks to enhance how we support members following an MIC urgent care visit (VUC and ED@Home) in hopes of:

Reducing Member Safety Events

Reduce likelihood of an MIC urgent care visit resulting in a ED visit and/or IP Admission




Solution pain points of current state MIC Urgent care handoff process:

Clear Accountability & Responsibility

Clear Expectations

New Reporting

Rollout Operational Best Practices  

Solutions will be focused on improving this portion of the MIC Urgent Care process 
Maureen to Intro, Opportunity + Goals 
Pass of to Sney

Sney to cover MIC Cheat Sheet Slide deck

Important Notes: that every MIC Urgent Care visit saves $1,000 on average. This is because we are able to solve the majority of our members' urgent care issues with our in house urgent care services (in a much quicker time frame than the ER, and for $0 in cost to them instead of thousands of dollars for a hospitalization). Having members 'call us first' is integral to the company meeting its diversion and TCOC reduction targets 

MIC Urgent Care Handoff Workflow Elements 
Clear Expectations

SCRIPT:

What’s Changing & When?

What’s changing? 
Commons task statuses will no longer used for reporting. Changing a task to a ‘Completed’ status within 4 days is no longer a measure of performance. 
Brand new reporting will be based on whether actions were taken / documented. Follow up actions must be attempted within 4 day SLA. 
It will no longer be unclear what actions are expected to fulfill the recommendations of the MIC Provider 
The ACEL tool will define more precise actions the MIC Provider expects to be done with the member  
Accountability within the markets will no longer be inconsistent / fluid
CTLs (or equivalent) will be accountable for the handoff queue, the members Primary Team Member will be responsible for all handoff actions 
What’s not changing? 
The handoff workflow will still be a single, generic task that appears in the existing handoff queue

Urgent or time sensitive escalations will be raised to market MMDs

The ACEL tool and Athena documentation will be used to communicate handoff details to the market team 
Changes will go into effect December 11th

Leverage Team Huddles 
Huddles should be leveraged for collaboration amongst the members care team on handoffs, especially when there are urgent needs
Effective Member Outreach
Primary Team member should conduct 3 outreach attempts across 3 different days following a handoff
Escalate Urgent Needs to MMDs
Urgent escalations should continue to be escalated from MIC through MMDs, MMDs are accountable for support in ensuring resolution 

Fully Execute Prescribed Follow Ups
Responsible longitudinal care team members should be sure to follow expectations as defined by the changes to ACEL question #10 within 4 days of handoff task generation
Foster Collaboration Between Market Providers and RNs 
Market Providers and RNs should work together to support urgent care handoffs, especially when extra support is required or escalations occur.


Monitoring MIC Handoff Queue & Report
Market leads should review the handoff queue at least 2x per day and help support primary team members with any road blocks


MIC Urgent Care Handoff Workflow| Best Practices 
Notes view: 72

Let’s Review!
These new workflow elements aim to improve coordination, clarity, and efficiency in member support processes, ultimately leading to enhanced member safety and improving care we provide our members while reducing avoidable hospital admissions.

Primary Care Team member  is the responsible owner: Reviews ACEL tool & ensures prescribed actions are taken
CTLs or Market equivalent is the accountable owner: Monitoring queue and report
Brand new reporting will be based on whether actions were taken / documented. Follow up actions must be attempted within 4 day SLA. 

The ACEL tool will define more precise actions the MIC Provider expects to be done with the member

Responsive
Focused & Intensive
The Primary for care has the ultimate responsibility for making sure that progress is being made toward the member’s optimal health by creating and driving team accountability to a well crafted Care Plan. 

The Primary may be the one with the most member contact in some cases, but not others. Contact with the member should be the most frequent with whatever staff is most likely to create progress on the Care Plan, and it is the role of the Primary to ensure that this is happening.




Non-urgent
not urgent, but represents a change in status or change in symptoms
Urgent
 if not addressed within the calendar day, will have a negative impact
Emergent
if not immediately addressed will have a profound negative impact
Call 911, perform CPR if necessary/as able.
After transfer to higher level of care, document fully, notify care team members, and notify PCP.

See Cityblock Escalations (link) and BH Escalations (link).

Cityblock Escalations Policy
Determining if a clinical need is emergent, urgent, or non-urgent will delineate the pathway to escalate.
Non-clinical care team members should always escalate to a clinical care team member if a member has surfaced a clinical question or concern; unless emergent, activate emergency escalation pathway immediately.
Clinical care team members should escalate to a clinical team member with more advanced training if concerned about new symptoms or medical decision making 
Access Clinical Longitudinal Care Team and/or Virtual Urgent Care
After transfer to appropriate level of care, document fully, notify care team members, and notify PCP.

See guide on when to call VUC (link). 
Care team member should escalate to RN and/or the pod provider for review, assessment, and management.
SCRIPT:

How do I escalate in my new pod?
As a CHP/Member Navigator: How do I know when to pull in my clinical partner (RN, Provider)?
At baseline, CHPs and Member Navigators should be familiar with the CBH escalations policy. 
Any time a member is reporting a symptom of disease (especially a new one that, to your knowledge, has not been evaluated), you should make your RN aware.
Any Core Assessment that reveals a symptomatic clinical condition, should be shared with RN with request for identification of red flags & guardrails
Trust your gut and if you feel like something is off, work with your RN or leadership to understand who to call if your RN isn’t available. 


As an RNCM/Resource RN: How do I ensure my CHP dyad is feeling supported and has opportunity to consistently review member clinical needs?
Ensure regular cadence of huddles and open communication
Be responsive in real time as much as possible
Make sure your CHP knows who to call if you can’t be reached
Always be receptive to questions! But make it very clear that general education around a clinical topic does not mean you are transferring authority to act on those topics (education on the disease of diabetes doesn’t mean CHP can treat diabetes)
Ask your CHP for their input and advice; treat them as the person you escalated social situations to
Ask your CHP is there is anything you can do to further their work during your interactions with the member (things to assess for beyond your own assessment needs; or language they might want you to use that is in line with their approach)


Scenario Walkthrough
Scenario 1: RN and CHP collaborate on a Symptom Action Plan intervention
RN is responsible for assessing members needs, writing the Symptom Action Plan, providing clinical education
CHP can help with follow-up calls related to the Symptom Action Plan to ensure appropriate connection to social needs (food, transportation to appointments), DME (e.g., scale, pillbox) or act as health coach to help log levels, 

Scenario 2: Something about either creating or updating the care plan

Marigny to add other examples that would be less clinically complicated

SCRIPT:

Cityblock Care Model | Minimum Contact Cadence

Why set a minimum contact cadence?

Keep us in the member’s mind
Ensure we have triggers to follow up on any outstanding work
Get ahead of any decompensations
Keep the Care Plan up to date

Can I contact the member more often?

Yes, but… panel sizes are set to accommodate the minimum cadence.  For more frequent contact you may find the need to enlist external, specialty, help.  Or, request that member be moved to a higher track.

Frequently Asked Questions
How are you accounting for my market-specific contractual requirements and population nuances?
A strong partnership between the Care Services Product Group and Markets will lead to market-configurable coordinated, sequenced rollouts that minimize disruption to care teams and lay the foundation for consistent and measurable delivery of care. Yes, we will account for contract obligations and market nuances AND we think the guiding principles leave room for flexibility and interpretation of them. If there are design principles which seem particularly challenging, we [1] want to make sure we have strong partnership where Markets feel supported with the right information and clarity and [2] are accounting for configurability with retention to the long-term vision and intent in mind (i.e., is this upholding the care model? Is this the best thing for members? Staff? Sustainable op ex?)

How does this work drive my MSP targets?
The Core Services set of engagement expectations has been designed by our clinical team as the minimum standard to drive improved outcomes and TCOC reduction, backed by clinical judgement based on lit review and BIPD research suggesting interaction every 2 weeks is needed to progress on care goals. Note: the minimum interaction for high-risk members in the Core Services model is conservatively monthly by RNCM and CHP.  Additionally, alignment on a common set of requirements will allow our product teams to build Commons enhancements that better enable our teams to efficiently and effectively deliver care.

Are the job title transitions associated with changes in compensation and leveling? 
There is no change in compensation or leveling with the exception of any CHPs moving into BH CHP roles where there is a higher salary band for BH CHPs. For BH CHPs staying in their BH CHP roles there is no impact (link to salary crosswalk).

Will the scope of my job change?
The general scope of your job will not significantly change. The adjustments to the JDs are focused on tighter alignment to the care model, strengthening top of license practice, and establishing more clarity and competency expectations between team members. You can expect more tactical changes in: (1) consistent expectations around community presence so  RNCMs and CHPs are well positioned to conduct home visits on high/rising risk members who would benefit from more in-person support, (2) standard job skills and competencies required, (3) team collaboration expectations, and (4) intentional and focused BH integration.

How does the staffing calculator(s) that I’ve seen fit into pod reconfiguration? 
Markets should reconfigure teams as needed and rebalance workload across staff already in seat based on risk (e.g., segmentation, acuity) and engagement (e.g., consented) indicators. The calculators could be a helpful historical starting point on estimated FTEs needed in required roles (e.g., Member Navigator, Resource RN), though likely will not be the single end source of truth and should be supplemented with Market-specific knowledge to make decisions on any tradeoffs (e.g., hybrid roles, hub model alignment with membership demand, contract obligations).

My team is maxed out on change, how are we going to make this feel like an improvement, and not just change for change sake?
The Execution Leads will be embedding the “why” into all communications templates and rollout materials. The partnership with Market Operations Leads will ensure that all changes are fully embedded into care teams’ day-to-day workflows, anchored on providing teams with tools to more efficiently self-manage their work (e.g., user-friendly lists and dashboards in the short term, with product enhancements on the horizon).

SCRIPT:

Map current variation in roles to future positions with standardized JDs 
(e.g., map 37 current RN roles in workday to 5 standardized RN JDs)
Standardize care team JDs
Reconfigure pods to enable Core Services activities based on member track 
(e.g., ensure care teams are configured around a pod provider)

In this case, we are using Care Services Product Team as the larger group of people who is running toward a full implementation of Core Services. This includes: Product, Product Enablement, Analytics, and Clinical Innovation.

Q4 2023
Phase 1a: Foundational Market Infrastructure

Implement cross-cutting foundational structure to all markets to enable Core Services.
Q4 2023, Q1 2024
Phase 1b: Implement Foundational Tools and Process, Continue Ongoing Planning/Design
Build on our foundational structure by adding process and tech capabilities
Developing clinical guidance for condition specific pathways (to be rolled out in 2024)
Conducting market-specific gap assessments and prioritization of work
2024 
Phase 2: Clinical Guidance and Ongoing Product Support
Implement condition specific pathways + strong clinical guidance
Continued product improvement and development
Iterative, smaller implementations

Phasing Core Services Implementation
SCRIPT:

Across Cityblock, different teams have come together to design, prepare, and execute on the planning needed to implement this work.
A large and complex body of work, Core Services has been broke down into manageable phases [link], making it easier to digest and implement into markets.
What’s next:
This quarter, in partnership with Market Ops, we will be implementing our first phase: Core Services Foundations. These foundations will lay the groundwork for further Core Services implementations in 2024.

⭐️Launch Core Services activities
Enable  teams to prioritize member activities based on need
To successfully adapt Core Services Foundations guidance to meet market specific needs, Market Ops Leads have partnered closely with the Care Services Product Group on each of the five identified steps.
SCRIPT:

We’ll be standardizing Care Team JDs, team reconfiguration activities and caseload rebalancing, launching core services track and launching panel management and contact cadence workflow (only a subset of activities for now)

SCRIPT: 

Team structure overview: ‘The vision’ of core services structures teams to support social and clinical needs.
Which roles involved? Social care (mem nav & CHP) /  clinical roles (RNs)
Point person: work with other role to manage member care (together are both responsible)
They have the ultimate responsibility for making sure that progress is being made toward the member’s optimal health. The Point Person is generally the person who has the most contact with the member. There may be cases where someone besides the Point Person has the most member contact, but the Point Person still has ultimate responsibility for progress.
Backup structure: every RN has a social care person as backup and vice versa (depends on track which is which)

Need to explain point person a bit better: use definition doc. 

To enable care, we use data signals (e.g., predictive analytics, algorithms) as a starting point for planning care and apply clinical judgement (paired with assessments, screenings, and member interactions) to determine the best course of action.
Member Tracks Incorporates Data Signals and Clinical Judgement
The “Best Guess” Data Signal 


Member Segmentation as a data signal, is an algorithm* which leverages claims data to predict members’ health risk: low, rising, high.
Clinical Judgement & Validation

Care team members apply clinical and professional judgment to validate, dispel, or supplement initial algorithm assessment on risk.
Ultimate Determination on Track











Care team determines members’ track by matching their needs to the appropriate care intensity level: responsive, focused, intensive. 

The default Core Services Track will be aligned with Member Segmentation, but if health needs change, Care Teams will have the ability to change the member’s track through defined clinical guidance and Commons workflow.
SCRIPT:

How do we make the ultimate determination on a member track? [will double click into this info in upcoming slides]
Data signals, based on claims data, will provide the initial starting point for care planning. 
Clinical judgement (will have the guidance / workflow in place to request a track change if needed)
Segmentation is our initial guess at member track, based on claims data available
Default track assignments will be set to match segmentation 1:1 
Pre-Consented member tracks will update as segmentation refreshes monthly

Segmentation & Track
Low = Responsive
Rising = Focused
Unassigned = Focused**** call out
High = Intensive

Core services tracks are a byproduct of a data signal and clinical judgement and validation 
You know what your member needs - apply clinical expertise to tracks. Highlight clinical judgement piece and ability to apply. 

"For markets that use acuity, the concept is quite similar in enabling clinicians to apply their judgements on member's health risk”


Member Tracks | All Members will be assigned a default track in Commons
SCRIPT:

Review of where CTMs can see member track
Note that segment and other important indicators can be seen on the health summary card as well


Member Tracks | Track Change Request Workflow 
SCRIPT:

Identification of track in Commons
Step by step walkthrough of track change request WF (note in voiceover to refer back to clinical guidelines to assess appropriateness to change track)
Touch on what happens after request is submitted before moving on to CTL workflow [next slide]

Member Tracks | CTL Approval Workflow
SCRIPT: Locked Workflow Template

Add to voiceover: submitter will get alerted that the workflow was actioned (changed or cancelled / denied)


Inbox - member track change queue
Filtering inbox per market
General guidance: if the care teams needs to change, use the guidance included in the WF for those nuances
Only show new way of approving WF

After a request is submitted it goes to the CTL for approval (or cancellation)
Talk through where they can find the request
Walk through the full workflow
Show member after track change has been approved with new track
Refer back to clinical guidance as reference point

Panel Management | Minimum Contact Cadence

Why set a minimum contact cadence?

Keep us in the member’s mind
Ensure we have triggers to follow up on any outstanding work
Get ahead of any decompensations
Keep the Care Plan up to date
