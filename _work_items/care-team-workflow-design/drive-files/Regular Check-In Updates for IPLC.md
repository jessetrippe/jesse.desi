# **Regular Check-In Standards and Governance**

**Regular Check-In Standards**

**Purpose**  
Calling Members for a regular check-in at a defined cadence contributes to our comprehensive case management strategy. 

**Regular Check-In Activities**  
The required activities for a regular check-in are included in the “Successful Regular Check-In”  template, including: 

* Summary (including Member’s reported updates and new or worsening conditions through a full review of the care plan)  
* Progress or regression on existing goals  
* Review of goal pathways  
* Action items (next step tasks that are added to the care plan)  
* Offer ICT Team Meeting   
* Annual Reassessment \- Due/Scheduled/Refused  
* CHP/RN Consultation, if applicable  
* Next Scheduled Follow-Up (Next steps, VUC education, care plan copy offer

**Regular Check-In Attempt Measurement**

| Successful | “Successful Regular Check-In” template is used to document the call,  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Unsuccessful  | “Unsuccessful Regular Check-In” template is used to document the call.  |

**Performance Targets**  
Reporting on Regular Check-In performance is included in the [Frontline Manager Visibility](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m2vr-hLqIKA3baSN1qQfeXR803ji-MVTcYhK8WIvM8Q/edit?gid=0#gid=0) tool being developed for IPLC MVP

| Regular Check-In Attempts on Time | Performance against Regular Check-In minimum required attempts (i.e. minimum 1 “Successful Regular Check-In” template or 2 “Unsuccessful Regular Check-In” templates before Regular Check-In due date) Target: 100% |
| :---- | :---- |
| Successful Regular Check-In Connection Rate | % of Members for which I am the primary whose most recent regular check-in was successful (i.e. used the "Successful Regular Check-In" template)  Target: 80% |

Regular Check-Ins: 

* Are surfaced in the Regular Check-In Feed within the redesigned Inbox  
* Remain visible in the Regular Check-In feed until the care team has either recorded:   
  * 1 “Successful Regular Check-In” template (any modality note template) OR  
  * 2+ “Unsuccessful Regular Check-In” templates (any modality note template) *AND* the Regular Check-In due date has passed.   
* Are programmatically removed from the Regular Check-In feed when either of the above criteria have been met  
* Will appear in the Regular Check-In feed 7 calendar days before its due date

**Regular Check-In Governance**

**🚧 TBD 🚧** 

**Regular Check-In “Reset” for IPLC Launch**

**Resetting overdue Regular Check-In Tasks**

* All overdue Regular Check-In Tasks will be programmatically archived when a market launches IPLC  
  * Request for Product: Distribute next Regular Check-In for all Members with legacy overdue Regular Check-In tasks across a user’s calendar (i.e. do not make all overdue Regular Check-Ins due for IPLC launch day.)  
    * Follow up questions:   
      * Should RCI due dates be manually editable?   
      * How do we account for legacy due date in setting new due date  
    * Follow up considerations:   
      * MA has compliance requirements for RCI due dates, we likely can’t flex these. 

**Regular Check-In Due Date Distribution within User Panel**

* Ideally, Regular Check-Ins due for a Primary’s whole panel are evenly distributed across the calendar  
  * Request for Product: (a)  Identify what currently directs a Member’s Regular Check-In due date and (b) explore solutions to accommodate even distribution across the calendar for  a Primary’s whole panel.   
* The staffing calculator and All-for-One track adjustments to accommodate it are targeting 7 Regular Check-Ins due, per user per day
