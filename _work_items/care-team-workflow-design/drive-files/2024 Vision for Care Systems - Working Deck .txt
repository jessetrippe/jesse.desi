Cityblock Theory of Change
We were founded on a clear theory of change: 
In order to meaningfully improve health outcomes and increase the value of care for those who have been left behind, we need a new approach for how care is delivered, one that centers on high-touch member engagement, provides high-quality care that integrates physical, behavioral and social health, and is supported by best-in-class data and technology.

“Scaling” is different than “growing” - and often happens in a predictable order of operations  

Care Systems Mission
Scale the impact of our Care Teams on Member Experience and Total Cost of Care

The impact of care teams happens through member encounters and care coordination
Proactive 
Reactive
Proactive encounters are the things we execute on without a trigger - things like regular check ins, scheduled visits, goals teams set for themselves, their team, and their members. 
Reactive encounters are triggered by an event, internal or external, driven by the member or a new piece of information.
Existing examples are regular check ins, scheduled clinical appointments, daily work through established tasks
Existing examples are IP and ED admits, discharges, and members requesting urgent care or ED @ home

In the future… regular check ins will be even more predictable and proactive. Care Team ceremonies will be impactful and a great use of time. 
In the future … we may have stronger approaches for managing non urgent member inbounds, and changes in member health status

Across my panel, which members do I focus on?
Prioritization at a glance with suggested care activities tailored to steps of the member journey (onboarding, ongoing care)

Prioritization logic is configurable by key operations and data stakeholders.
Panel Management

Right now we ask teams to look at a variety of tools to prioritize their work. 
Three themes that have surfaced in our user research are prioritization, proactiveness, and curation. How do these priorities fit into the reality of someone’s work day? Dovetail Which signals do we present to a care team member and how can they dive deeper and execute on the next step?

For my member, what are key focus areas? 
Care teams upskilled in motivational interviewing, trauma-informed care & identifying root cause drivers of member health in order to understand what matters most and identify impactful focus areas.

Data signals will inform the work we do for our members, prompting users with suggested care activities.
Suggested care activities on Member 360
Initial Care Planning: During the onboarding process, care delivery would likely be focused on creating an initial care plan. What does it looks like to better translate assessments and all the data we have on a member, to an initial set of items that the care team and member would focus on? 

RN or CHP would schedule the initial call. Then with an updated pathway suggestion toolset or goal template library, how can we better support care teams in creating an initial care plan. 

Care teams think of care planning broadly, as all longitudinal member interactions and care delivery. This means, we may be neglecting the act of clear & collaborative goal setting. ref


For a focus area, what are the next steps?
Commons recommends next best actions based on data signals

Template libraries are more inclusive of all interventions including member goals and care team workflows.

A centralized work surface

Quick access to the context and tools care teams need to get their work done.


Problem - Care teams have to navigate to too many different surfaces to gather information about work to be done, and then to document and execute their work (notes, tools, appointments, etc.)
Vision - Provide a single surface that brings together all of the context and tools the care team needs to get their work done.

Automated task progress tracking

At-a-glance visibility into what work has been completed and what’s outstanding. 
Problem - It’s difficult for care teams to understand where a member is in a multistep process, what work is done, and what work still needs to be done. 

Vision - Commons provides at-a-glance visibility into all work that has been completed and all work that’s still outstanding to ensure care teams are delivering the highest quality of care to all of our members, every time.

Dynamic workflow tasks

Customizable work instruction based on market, payor, risk profile, and more.
Problem - Workflows prescribe a one-size-fits all process to care teams, forcing teams to hold context in their heads about any process variations that are needed based on different member attributes.

Vision - Workflows are customizable and can provide dynamic instruction based on market, payor, line of business, risk profile, and many other member attributes when we need our care teams to follow different processes and take different steps.

User-built workflows

Tooling to enable non-technical staff to create and update workflows and business rules.
Problem - All updates to Workflows and Business Rules are currently made in code by the engineering team, which is costly, inefficient, and leads to Workflows falling out of date.

Vision - Provide a suite of tools that enable non-technical staff to design, build, and update existing Workflows and Business Rules.

All Programs must be shared with Markets - and that collaboration must be structurally enabled

A Lesson From Core Services Foundations

While our xfn team was strong to begin with, with Market Ops fully integrated. Embedding Libby into the working team accelerated our progress, influence, and decision making capability significantly. For any major company initiative - like regular check ins, we need market representation at the highest level. We need to set the expectation that these leaders both “lead” (offer direction)  and “do” (do work to bring that direction to life) in order for these programs to be successful. The teams that matter most to get things done, are the explicit cross functional teams we design. 

For upcoming major programs we should ask the following questions, and then structurally enable focused teams: 
Who is the key leader driving this body of work?
What teammates across the entire organization do they need dedicated to get that work done?

Care Systems Mission
To impact total cost of care, consistently deliver on our brand promises at scale

By 2025, we must be consistently delivering on our promises at scale
We promise members something different, but today with the exception of localized care team heroism -  we often fall short of those promises at scale. 

In 2024, we must ruthlessly refocus as a single cityblock team on the central member journey delivering on the moments that matter, as a mechanism to hit our goals

2024 Care Systems Strategy & Tactics
Invest in core member and care team value props, with scalable tech and process

In 2024, we’ll focus on establishing and scaling excellence in four key member moments
Key Constraints on Success 📉👎

Inconsistent and unclear panel prioritization
Work Processes outside of core systems - unobservable, and unautomated. 
Limited to no visibility on core member touch points like inbound calls or onboarding calls. 
Limited data to trigger reactive help 
Poor coordination between siloed cityblock teams
Teams work around our tools, when we can’t move fast enough to configure for them
Limited and ineffective skill building and competency assurance for care teams. 
Teams uncertain what to focus on with a member. 


Then, we’ll focus on 5 key areas* to make sure care teams are successful and satisfied delivering member moments 
Successful care teams == successful members
#1 Easy, proactive prioritization across panels, and member focus areas
#2 Effective, efficient, and automated workflow coverage
#3  Effective internal member handoffs and loop closure
#4 Strategic, consistent compliance investment
#5 Step level increases in operator led Commons configuration
*Key areas does not mean these are the only things. About 25% of our time will be spent maintaining our systems, fixing bugs, implementing new business, and tackling opportunistic projects as warranted.

Onboarding
What is our target member onboarding experience? 🎯
What is onboarding? 
A process to manage and track the movement of a member from the initial outreach funnel into an ongoing longitudinal engagement with their care team. A member is fully onboarded when they have had any successful connection with their care team, they have completed all intake assessments, they have agreed to baseline consents, and they have a documented care plan with at least one shared goal.

Are members supported after conclusion of an Acute Cityblock event / program? 
MIC -> Longitudinal 
The v2 redesign in Q4 set expectations and increased visibility but we must monitor performance and outcomes to understand where we fall short from the vision 
TOC -> Longitudinal 
A handoff process exists but it is missing the inclusion of Core Services foundations, effective tooling, nudges and reporting to ensure success 
VISION
Clear expectations are established between teams for when / how a member is appropriately handed off with clear ownership transition point
Users have the right tools / forums to exchange member & interaction information to ensure seamless member experience through handoff 
The system nudges users when a handoff occurs, ensuring no members slip through the cracks 
Teams have the reporting tools they need to monitor handoffs between teams 
Intentional handoff processes following MIC urgent care visits and TOC program completion

Are we able to effectively support our members when they ask for help? 
Inbound member call/text routing to get our members to the right care team member for support 
By the Numbers 
Cityblock receives 20k inbound calls per month 
Less than ~200 inbound texts per month, down from ~600 earlier this year 
45% of calls to MSC are to get in contact with a care team member 
24% of inbound calls are disconnected within first 30 seconds
Users have the tools they need to efficiently route member calls in a timely manner, with little to no added administrative efforts on clinical staff 
We have processes to ensure member need resolution to support trust building with clear operational visibility 
Right systems and reports in place to monitor inbound call routing 
CURRENT STATE
VISION
Calls can’t be routed to all care team members because not all users routinely utilize TalkDesk, our call routing system 
We have little to no insight into whether member needs are in fact resolved upon transfer 
We have little visibility into call routing operations in current systems
MSC tooling and processes do not allow for flexibility in member routing based on member info / program engagement  
System-led nudges / tooling to help MSC route member calls to the “right” person based on member need 

What will initial care plan development & regular check-ins (care planning) look & feel like by the end of 2024?
Care planning is everything we do for our members; we may be neglecting the act of clear & collaborative goal setting
Care planning is redefined as two distinct, valuable activities, enabled by Commons tooling. 
Initial care plan development: we listen to what matters most, “hook” members with impactful & meaningful interventions we can deliver, and develop a plan
Regular Check-Ins: we deliver on the promises made, help members make progress against goals & celebrate shared achievements
We see infrequent care plan updates & progress
Care plan quality varies, impacting its usefulness as a communication & coordination tool across teams
Care plans are high quality, enabling teams to work, coordinate care & communicate efficiently
Care planning/the care plan is more valuable for care teams than members, despite member interest in this service 
We are not providing members with sufficient access to physical & digital member-facing care plans 
Members have access to physical & digital copies of their member-centric care plan to support self-management 
Commons users have unmet documentation & decision support needs 
Commons enables efficient care planning documentation and aids users in decision making 
Today…
By End of 2024…
How We Get There…
Redefine & reinforce care plan purpose 
Team skill building & reference content development: motivational interviewing, identifying root cause drivers, trauma informed care, shared decision making, building high quality care plans, goal prioritization
Clear care team R&R
Define expectations & process
Digital checklists / workflows
Panel management tooling
Revamp goal template library
Care plan suggestions & signals
Simplified documentation 
Member-centric physical & digital care plans
Leverage scaled comms 
“I think what motivates [members] is seeing progress and what motivates them is the feeling heard aspect” - ARN
“I think once we get to the point where everybody is comfortable with [care planning], it'll be a lot better than it is” - RNCM
“[what members] appreciate most is the engagement, us calling them reaching out to them following up.. that's what I think is the biggest motivation… but you can't call with no direction. So the care plan is the direction” - RN
Today, care planning feels like any any everything we do for our member, and the care plan / care planning discussions vary in quality / impact
In 2024, we will shift to thinking about care planning as two distinct activities: initial care plan development when you first meet your care team & meaningful, high quality regular check ins every 30/60/90 days to make progress against the care plan. The care plan surface will create visibility to enable coordination & communication across teams. 
We will enable this through team skill building, process redesign, scaled comms & digital tooling such as suggested activities, panel management, workflows, templates

The purpose & intent of case conference varies today. Some case conference discussions are more valuable for care teams than others.
Case conference guidance (who & when) varies greatly today
We are not properly prioritizing members for discussion & see case conference bottlenecks
Case conference is a resource-intensive activity
Case conference is an effective & efficient use of care team time
Case conference tracking is manual & relies heavily on CTLs
Commons tooling enables efficient & painless case conference tracking & scheduling 
Today…
How We Get There…
We take a cadenced approach to case conference
Case conference is productive, focused, and action-oriented. It is a forum for problem solving & helping to unblock teammates who need support 
We take a needs-based approach, case conferencing members who need it the most
Redefine case conference purpose & intent

“We attend all [case conferences] every Tuesday and Thursday… Even if you don't have any [members] to present, you're usually still there” - RN
By End of 2024…
What will case conference look & feel like by the end of 2024?
Today, case conference is a resource intensive activity, we are not effectively prioritizing members for discussion, and case conference discussions vary in quality/value. 
In 2024, case conference will be an effective use of case team time, result in meaningful, action-oriented discussion, and take a needs based approach. 
We will focus on resource optimization, member prioritization efforts, improved tracking tooling, data signals to indicate case conference needs, and escalation tooling.

First, we need to change our approach to product* development, or we won’t achieve our vision
A focus on Cityblock goals and value props
A focus on Care Team and Member Value Props
Tactical, reactive builds to “hot” initiatives
A clear, 2 year strategy to nail our brand promises. 
A divided Central and Market mental model
A single organizational shared strategy + KPIs - with no middle men between care teams  and product
A “stick,” control-based and punitive care team management style
A “carrot,” celebratory, and continuous improvement style of management
*Product here  is not the function, but the discipline of designing, building, ‘selling’, and supporting  a compelling offering for care teams, members, and partners. 
Informal, impromptu user support
Clearly funded and scoped tool and process support channels for care teams
Reliance on engineering for customization
A clear strategy with aligned upon elements of operator configurability.

Framework for longitudinal care
Go forward mental model to thread all the expressions of work
All the work that we ask care teams to do, whether it be proactive or reactive, follow the same life cycle. It starts with a data signal, then helping our teams understand why they’re seeing that, then supporting care teams in preparing for, executing on, and following up on the relevant activity. How does the platform support teams in structuring their workflows and automating when possible for the best user and member experience. 


By 2025, we must be consistently delivering on our promises at scale
We promise members something different, but today with the exception of localized care team heroism -  we often fall short of those promises at scale due to inconsistent strategy around and investment in tooling + the success of field teams, inconsistency in our contract and implementation processes, and ineffective training and change management in a remote environment

In 2024, we must ruthlessly refocus as a single cityblock team on the central member journey delivering on the moments that matter, as a mechanism to hit our goals
initial trust building + influence when we first meet a member digitally, virtually or in person. 
the onboarding experience to know what to focus on, and how we can most help
our proactive care + care planning to stay present for our members
our reactive acute services to be there when members are at their lowest

To do this, we need to explicitly measure, and hold ourselves accountable to the success and satisfaction of our field teams as well as our members. If we don’t show up explicitly for them, they cant show up for our members.

We’ll know its working if by the end of the year every member reports high trust in their longitudinal care teams, receives consistent proactive support to manage and achieve their goals, and rapid reactive support when things go wrong. Care teams should report that their tools and systems help them, and that it’s easy and obvious to find what they need, know what to focus on to drive member outcomes, and do their work efficiently.

Problems to solve
Onboarding, intake checklist, and new processes mean there is fragmentation and heterogeneity in practice. 

Problems to solve
These are of varying efficacy
Regular check ins are inefficient, and often not focused on the most impactable areas. 

Problems to solve
We have no visibility into our inbound calling reasons, or quality of our response. 
Anecdotally members often are trying to reach a member of their team, and wind up in phone tag. 


Problems to solve
While we support reacting for TOC, we dont react to other key changes in member health. 
Processes remain largely manual and click heavy. 
Interventions are working, but could be even more innovative and adaptive to member needs.

2024 Care Systems Vision
Consistently deliver on our brand promises at scale

By 2025, we must be consistently delivering on our promises at scale
We promise members something different, but today with the exception of localized care team heroism -  we often fall short of those promises at scale due to inconsistent strategy around and investment in tooling + the success of field teams, inconsistency in our contract and implementation processes, and ineffective training and change management in a remote environment

In 2024, we must ruthlessly refocus as a single cityblock team on the central member journey delivering on the moments that matter, as a mechanism to hit our goals
initial trust building + influence when we first meet a member digitally, virtually or in person. 
the onboarding experience to know what to focus on, and how we can most help
our proactive care + care planning to stay present for our members
our reactive acute services to be there when members are at their lowest

To do this, we need to explicitly measure, and hold ourselves accountable to the success and satisfaction of our field teams as well as our members. If we don’t show up explicitly for them, they cant show up for our members.

We’ll know its working if by the end of the year every member reports high trust in their longitudinal care teams, receives consistent proactive support to manage and achieve their goals, and rapid reactive support when things go wrong. Care teams should report that their tools and systems help them, and that it’s easy and obvious to find what they need, know what to focus on to drive member outcomes, and do their work efficiently.





Our focus for last year was on foundations, so why are we  still talking about scale + foundations? 




56% of Cityfolx feel they don’t have the systems and processes they need to support getting their work done effectively. It drops to 51% when you isolate to just care teams. 
Care teams report hours of manual work to manage key rules based processes and aggregating member context for ceremonies like case conference. 
“I only use Inbox at the end of the week (if at all) as an afterthought. It often contains too many tasks that aren’t relevant to my day-to-day or even week,” - NY CHP
“After the re-org my case-load doubled and now the Inbox has become too difficult to manage.” - NY CHP
Despite a 30% utilization rate in aggregate for September, we are not sure where the other time is going for our providers. 

We consistently receive CAPs related to routine care plan + encounter documentation. 
Today, despite our desire, we are unable to drive broad scaled change across our programs, and instead invest in market by market custom training, roll outs, and testing. 

“Designer: Are you all using acuity or segmentation today? 
CTL: Both.”

“Scale” means that we are consistent, efficient, observable, and controllable in our delivery   
Consistent
Efficient
Observable
Controllable
39% of members verbally agree to our services, but only 17% have been activated

56% of members do not have any active goals. However, this decreases as track intensity increases (R: 77%, F: 82%,I: 35%)

80%+ of members across all tracks have not had an update to a goal that wasn't a deletion or archival in the past 90 days

72% of consented & enrolled members do not have any completed goals on their care plan.

While we achieve targets for case conference, front line teams report lack of clarity on the intent or purpose of the ceremony .

The context for Cityblock’s growth and scale has been a complex one, with a number of factors at play

Strategic Leadership Churn →  We have had a rotating cast of characters leading the technology org, the clinical org, and our operations. This has led to inconsistent vision and strategy to guide the teams. 

Lack of clarity on which model to scale → While the earliest part of this timeline predates me, there have been a variety of leads reinventing our model, which has led to a significant amount of care model debt, and a technology org which has been poised for a long time to invest in the “right” or “new” model, and not waste effort on legacy components. 

Major funding, exec onboarding, and mismatched expectations -> Following major funding rounds during the pandemic, we brought in leaders to operate a large organization, but failed to finish scaling our tech and process to enable them to operate an org at scale. The system we think we are controlling is not yet built to be strategically controlled.

*this is bias, imperfect, and likely incomplete. Intention is to demonstrate the experience  of ground truth of where we are, and how we have been building our product to date. 

How did we wind up here? (2 of 2)
There is no single shared understanding of our core experience and offering. Cityblock does not share an understanding of the essence of what we offer to our members, and what the most important moments in that journey truly are. In addition, we have sold configurable elements on a model that has not yet scaled to be configurable.

To do this, we need to focus as a group and company on measuring what matters for our members
A clear baseline member journey + moments that matter

Cityblock must have a shared vision for our member experience, and the outcomes that we want to scale, regardless of the mechanism to scale them. 


Shared top line metrics based on that journey


From the top to the bottom of the organization we should be able to answer questions like…

Are we able to reach and find members effectively?
Are we able to sell them on Cityblock?
Are we onboarding them to care properly?
Are we delivering on our promises to build plans and make progress against them?
Are we focusing on the areas most impactable for our members?
Are we seeing members adopt and report satisfaction with our reactive services?

Today we have 5 layers of metrics, on a sheet that is hard to understand and to use. How might we simplify to start? 

2024 Care Systems Strategy & Tactics
Invest in core member and care team value props, with scalable tech and process

First, we need to change our approach to product* development, or we won’t hit our goals + vision

Guarantee Care Systems Group 2024 Strategic Themes (+8 engineers)
                    Current
KTLO (+3 FTE)
Success (+8 FTE)
1. Ease, consistency, and impact of our proactive care, core services.
(clear panel prioritization, member custom recommendations for focus areas, consistent care planning, case conference, care coordination and assessment)
⚠️Care Delivery team will deliver many, but not all, improvements to our longitudinal care model.
✅High level of confidence that Care Delivery team could deliver all planned improvements and support a successful Core Services rollout with an additional FTE engineer (1).
✅No additional work slated beyond implementing Core Services.
2. Speed, reliability, and impact of our acute care.
(full alert coverage and easy member summarization, quick a reliable handoffs and communication between acute and longitudinal teams)
⚠️TOC team will continue to advance our workflows, but anticipate being delayed by requirements for new implementations.
✅High level of confidence in ability to execute on acute/ longitudinal care team handoffs, alert reliability, and additional workflow improvements with an additional FTE engineer (2).
✅No additional work scheduled past the already defined speed, reliability, and impact improvements to acute care.
3. Efficiency in our Commons tooling.
(search, curation, summarization, automation, and awareness of what others are doing in the product)
❌No teams able to dedicate meaningful time to improve Commons tooling.
❌No teams able to dedicate meaningful time to improve Commons tooling.
⚠️Two add’l engineers spread across teams will enable them to speed up roadmap and begin tackling efficiency opportunities in Commons (4, 5).
4. Supporting growth by starting every market, partner, and cohort on the right foot.
(a compelling new market playbook with the latest lessons from other markets)
❌No teams able to dedicate meaningful time to improving our technological foundations for scaling growth.
⚠️Each team dedicating some amount of time to supporting Cityblock’s growth goals, but no team fully focused on scaling new implementations.
✅Three engineers would be dedicated to responding to compliance, allowing Member Profile team to restart work to support growth and partner success (6, 7, 8).
5. Ensuring ongoing compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements.
⚠️Member Profile working to ensure Cityblock meets contractual and regulatory compliance requirements.
✅High confidence in Member Profile’s ability to ensure Cityblock meets compliance requirements with an additional FTE engineer (3).
✅No additional work would be needed to ensure compliance needs met with strategic investment.

Growth: Market, partner, and member growth imposes 3 categories of cost on Cityblock engineering teams.
1️⃣ Application customization needed to support the configuration of each implementation. Currently, much of this customization lives in code, but once we complete the configuration layer we are building (Builder UI for content, and a similar configurator for broader feature sets) the amount of time engineering spends supporting this growth category will decrease dramatically. ⤵️
2️⃣ New feature builds are likely to accompany new implementations for the near future as Cityblock engages with partners differently than it has in the past (slightly different product offerings, new programs, additional integrations). However, as we grow our capabilities, the need for new feature builds will decrease with each new implementation, as will the amount of time engineering spends supporting growth category. ↘️
3️⃣ Operational support required to support a larger system with more data, more users, more features, and an ever increasing web of interactions between all those components. I expect engineering to scale proportionally with this growth category (albeit at a lower rate). ➡️

Without baseline hires, Care Systems engineering will focus on operational support, resulting in new feature builds coming at the expense of previously prioritized work (TOC/MIC workflow enhancements, Core Services, multi-payer market support). 3️⃣
With baseline hires, Care Systems will be able to prioritize both operational support and new feature builds while proceeding with previously prioritized work. 2️⃣& 3️⃣
With baseline and strategic hires, Care Systems will be able to complete existing work, support incremental implementation asks, and enable future growth by building a foundation of application customization that requires less and less engineering support for each incremental future market/partner/population. 1️⃣& 2️⃣& 3️⃣
Care Systems Group  | Risks

Care Systems Group  | Opportunities
Compliance: We will be able to complete engineering work to support regulatory and contractual compliance without compromising any existing roadmap items.

Operational support: Engineers currently dedicate most of their “operational support” time to incident response (IR) and system maintenance (~2 Care Systems engineers on call each month, and more helping with IR). By spinning out a dedicated Compliance team, teams that would otherwise have had to focus on compliance can instead focus on operational support within their domains. That capacity can be spent providing a higher level of service to users of Commons, serving as somewhat of “solutions engineers”  to help with account management, support market configuration, and respond to user feedback on existing feature implementation. By providing an application that is highly reliable, and team that is responsive to their needs, we can turn care teams into net promoters of Commons.

Delivery velocity: As the Care Systems group rolled off engineering contractors in Q3, the velocity of our teams fell disproportionately. When there are fewer than 4 engineers on a team they are no longer capable of working on multiple initiatives at once (as one or more engineer on each team is focused on operational support), have slack to support incident response, cannot dedicate time to future planning (resulting in a pattern of yo-yo-ing between planning and execution), and even more susceptible to dramatic slow downs as team members are out.

Staff to match 2023 H1 delivery velocity and scope (+8 engineers)
For the first half of 2023, Care Systems was delivering TOC process improvements, workflow enhancements, task management to-do lists, Care Plan features, goal activities, compliance requests, member signals, frequent visitor, business rules, partner transition support, calendar integration, Builder UI clinical content management, and more.
We cut scope in June 2023, as four engineers left the group to help with scheduling, so that the group was no longer working on the care plan, goals, nor compliance.
As contractors rolled off through the summer, we reduced the pace of delivery and shifted our focus to KTLO.
Care Systems is anticipating an increased scope in 2024, supporting growth, implementing core services, and dedicating more time to KTLO to ensure Commons remains a reliable platform for care teams to manage work.
Adding 8 engineers in the H1 2024 will enable Care Systems to take on this scope and return to H1 2023 pace of delivery and system reliability.

What we need to succeed outside our group
We control much of our own destiny, but we need full organizational alignment to be successful 



Care Systems is a powerful group, but we cannot drive these outcomes alone
The whole company must act as one team - focused on a clear set of shared member journey moments that matter, and metrics that tell us how we are doing. These should be top line for every market, and for our leaders. No MSPs that are different than central roadmaps that are different than clinical focus areas. Member Experience grounds everything. 

Market KPI Scorecard should be thought of as a “product” and managed by a single or set of senior product management leader(s)

We need differential re-investment in member onboarding as a discrete member journey life cycle component that builds trust, sets care teams up for success, and never misses a member who needs us.

We need a new way of supporting our field teams through change management today - that means deeper investment in field team training and enablement, manager coaching, product marketing and instructional design. How much attention did you pay to your virtual video compliance training? Exactly. 

We need to model a cultural shift away from traditional punitive measurement strategies, to one focused on celebrating wins, understanding what is constraining field teams, and lifting up the member moments that matter. Until we have removed the constraints on care teams to be successful, we shouldn't punish them for missing the mark. That’s on us. 

Product must partner more closely with growth to ensure we are driving an efficient and clear sales process - so we can be an easy vendor for plans to work with, and sell a consistent product we feel confident we can deliver, and report on.

Proposed

Budget impact
$1 million in incremental asks for all 8 engineers
Increasing engineers per team allows us to support more junior engineers than we have in the past
Hiring across 1A/1B/2B levels with an average annual salary of $120k for each of the 8 engineers (faster time to hire as well)

Striving for budget neutrality
Funded by growth
6 implementations for 1 Jan. Finance sheet lists ⅓ of $162k per implementation. If half of that total to Care Systems ($162k)
Existing implementations where headcount was not released in the past?
Moving headcount to support ongoing data-focused work from Data Platform? ($185k)
2 staff engineers dedicated to DPAPI support for more than 6 months ($185k annual cost per eng)
Several engineers in DP have worked within product previously, can we pull them back to product?
We are taking ownership of Member Importer and Enrollment Form
Spreading hiring across year (4 eng in H1, 4 eng in H2), effectively reducing request by 2 engineering-years ($240k)
Pulling ahead unused budget for current open headcount
From Aug-Oct 2023, open roles accounting for 6 engineering months of senior/staff salary (½ x $170k ⇒ $85k)
Borrowing budget from partner orgs across CBH?
Transitioning staff to other roles at the company?
Need to find $330k to reach budget neutral.

Are there areas where we may not have a budget issue, but where individuals aren't performing at the level we need them (leading to execution issues / tension)?
Are we overstaffed anywhere? Where are we inefficient, if we were more efficient would we be overstaffed?

Product Enablement skills + competencies. 
Ex: implementation skills + “training”  vs. multi-modal driving to adoption, UX Feedback, and satisfaction.


tl;dr
By the end of 2024 - we must consistently deliver on our brand promises.  Every member should report high trust in their longitudinal care teams, receive consistent proactive support to manage and achieve their goals, and rapid reactive support when things go wrong. Care teams should report that their tools and systems help them, and that it’s easy and obvious to find what they need, know what to focus on to drive member outcomes, and do their work efficiently.

In 2024, the Care Systems group strategy will focus on 6 areas: 

Easily and consistently answer the following care team questions: “across my panel, who should I focus on?” and “ for this member, what should I focus on?” 
Think: clear panel prioritization, member custom recommendations for focus areas, encounter wizard, enhanced case conferences to drive focus areas.

Invest in primitives that enable effective, efficient, and reliable acute, reactive care. 
Think: Easy member summaries, clear and obvious handoff process, automated triggers for reactive work, easy to manage workflows.

Disproportionately invest in Care Team Lead Success
Think: A Pod Level home page tracking to team based goals, trustworthy reporting for care team leads, clear roles and responsibilities and coaching for CTLs.

Invest in level-up Commons UX Enhancements for efficiency and scale 
Think: Search, “since you last viewed” and Automation. Awareness of what others are doing in the product. Deprecation of legacy element

Start every new market, partner and cohort on the right foot
Think: a compelling new market playbook with the latest lessons from other markets

Consistent investment in client reporting and compliance requirements 
Think: dedicated capacity for continuous improvement. 
Our tenants for how we prioritize what we build

Care Team  success + satisfaction above all else
Operator owned configuration for everything 💯
Reliable tools, platforms, and processes that scale
Continuous program improvement - day by day

The path to a model that scales has been a wild one! 

First, we were small and proscriptive
In NYC, and then in CT we were focused mostly on a single process, tight guardrails, and limited flexibility
Then overly flexible and un-opinionated 
And recently overly focused on corporate strategy + activities, and not on member journey  

On the Block Oct, 2023
Where we’ve been / Where we are
A focus on Cityblock goals and value props
Tactical, reactive builds to “hot” initiatives
A divided Central and Market mental model
A “stick,” control-based and punitive care team management style
Informal, impromptu user support
Reliance on engineering for customization
A focus on Cityblock goals and value props
A focus on Cityblock goals and value props
A focus on Cityblock goals and value props
A focus on Cityblock goals and value props

A focus on Cityblock goals and value props

Then we were flexible and opinionated! 

By the end of next year….
Cityblock care teams are connecting with members consistently enough to meet their needs, based on their segment, and never missing a best practice contact.
Members are engaged in collaborative care planning encounters — where teams are able to find the most impactful focus areas and build trust with members
Including talking about pathways, symptom action plans, and other primary focus areas. 
Every year, we are delivering baseline, best in class, preventative care, and evaluating what might have changed through assessments.
Managers and Eds feel confident that they can report on and celebrate their teams hitting contact, care planning, assessment, and other goals.
Members report that their care teams are meeting their needs, and never drop the ball.

Framework that can be added to // scaffolding that supports everything else // foundation for layered programs ++ 
How will this help me give better care? 
How does this help me contribute to the MSP? / Scorecard?
Pre-req for pop health. Infra that enables us to do things at scale. 
Re-brand needs to account less for “change” and more for “improvements” 
Recognition up front that these are tweaks, and not overhauls
Need to tell the value prop, and not the feature solution. 
Do we need a viewpoint of history
What framing do we need for different audiences
Business Outcomes Focused
