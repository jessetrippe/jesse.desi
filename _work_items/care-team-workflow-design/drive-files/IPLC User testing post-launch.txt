IPLC User Testing findings 
IPLC: User Testing Plan for Quick Validation


Key takeaways:
* Interface Overload: Consistently, users feel overwhelmed by the amount of information and tasks presented in the system. They feel this way about the 360º page widgets, with different users understanding or using the widgets very differently. They also feel this way about the Regular check-in folder in Inbox which shows members for whom we’ve conducted two outreach attempts for RCI until the due date has past.


* Task View Preferences: Users differ on how tasks should be displayed and managed (consolidated vs. separate tabs, 7-day vs. weekly view). Some users would like all their tasks in one folder. Others, want RCI or Due this week folders to only show this week and not a rolling view of 7 days. The 7-day rolling view of regular check-ins was described as unhelpful, as it gives a continuous sense of incompletion and doesn't provide the closure of finishing tasks within a work week.


Overwhelm on RCI Inbox folder:
* “I mean, this is just like overwhelming to look at, honestly. Um, I hate it. So, and it's not incredibly helpful for me or for anyone, I don't think, because one, I would really love to see like when these two attempts are made that this goes away. I mean, I understand that the idea is, "Oh, maybe you'll try again." I promise you, I'm not going to try again.” 
   * (Sarah, 00:00:54)
* “...that's just unnecessary for me right now. I mean, yeah, it's important stuff, but it's just like, you know, that could be a thing. It's just like, whoa. Like, when I first looked at this, it took me a while to even know what I was looking at when I first started. I don't know what – what all this is.”
   * (Jordan Transcript, 00:31:28)
* “I just would like a smaller snapshot or the option to um you know focus in more on the actual work week or work you know what I mean a smaller view um instead of the bigger view but you can always have that option.”
   * (Melissa Transcript, 00:06:46)
* On Inbox’s Due this week folder: “I wish it was just Monday to Friday”
   * (Sarah Transcript, 00:18:53)
Reaction to changes:
* On new Inbox folders: “it just hasn't helped me because I'm not a flipper and I'm not one of those people that keeps a bunch of tabs open and that kind of thing."
   * (Cheryl Transcript, 00:05:31)
360 Page Utility:
* "…now I do enjoy that they have like the next check-in date here. That's helpful." 
   * (Sarah Transcript, 00:05:50)
System Trust:
* Re: “On hold” RCI being shown on RCI widget on 360º page: “I don't think anybody trusts that the system's going to work because we get screwed by it. All the his attempts weren't made or if they don't make another attempt for this one, even though he's on hold. I assume like we're – I guess hoping that after March 10th passes that they're not going to be past due, but I just don't, I don't trust it.”
   *  (Sarah Transcript, 00:14:34)


Q: We’re showing “on hold” and due date both in inbox and 360 page, is it useful to see the due date if on hold? Why?
A: Sort of - users appreciate having more information rather than less on the 360 page’s RCI widget (though it’s worth noting most users felt the 360º was currently overwhelming and provided too much information) but showing ‘on hold’ members on the RCI inbox was not appreciated - especially seeing the due date get closer over time or become overdue. Users didn’t feel good about seeing work they couldn’t take actions to complete in their folder. 
Q: Do they notice the regular check-in icon? Is it valuable to denote a task as regular check-in or not? What makes a RCI task different from another task in their view?
A: It’s unclear. Many users relied on the Care Plan to review tasks to address. All participants disliked the widget showing all tasks on the 360º page because they preferred to see that task within the context of the goal. Never during interviews did a user set a due date to regular check-in when presented with the scenarios from the test plan.
Q: Does separating tasks, RCIs, and RCI tasks make sense (e.g. there’s nowhere to see ALL your work)?
A: For some users, yes. For others who were previously working in a way where they would see all their tasks in one place, no. 
Q: Should RCIs be hidden once two attempts are made regardless of due date? Why or why not?
A: According to our users, yes. Because they will not try to call more than two times and it clutters their folder. Many explained they work ahead and that the amount of members with two attempts would continue to grow and make this folder more cluttered over time.
Q: Is it useful to see 7 days work of RCIs? Is there a better way to limit them (so that “inbox zero” is more achievable)?
A: Yes. Most users preferred 7 day views to be limited to this week versus a rolling 7 days. One user proposed a 3 day range.
Q: Is showing “Due today and 7 days” more useful than “This week (Mon-Sun)”?
A: For the users that use this view (not all did) - they would prefer a limit to this week instead of a rolling 7 days because of overwhelm and a feeling that the work will never be done.
Q: We’re showing Previous appointment as well as Next appointment. Is it providing value?
A: It depends on the appointment. For MA users in particular who care about whether an APV or HRA is due or has been scheduled - that’s much more important than other appointment types. One of the four participants preferred to just go to the Appointments page. 
Q: We’re showing all upcoming and overdue tasks - is it providing value? Why or why not?
A: According to all of the users interviewed - it is not providing value. This is because they think about tasks in the context of the goals they relate to. One participant explained they would navigate the conversation with a member by asking about each goal and then the tasks related to them - whereas in the 360º widget, the tasks seemed scattered and disorganized. 
Q: Would adding cadence (acuity/track + number of days) to RCI widget for transparency and clarity? Why or why not?
A: One participant mentioned this would help new team members. However, many seemed to have the cadences and their relationship to acuity/track memorized. Based on their feedback while this could be useful information on the 360º - it would definitely not be helpful in the Inbox.

Summary
Jordan Washington-Freda detailed their daily workflow, which involves prioritizing tasks based on acuity and urgency using the acuity dashboard (in Looker) and Commons Inbox, while navigating member pages and utilizing various tools for efficient task completion. Washington-Freda suggested improvements to the 360 page for better organization and information clarity, emphasizing the importance of balancing helpful features with efficient workflow.


Jordan has been with the company for just over a year.


Details
* Daily Workflow in Comments: Jordan Washington-Freda described their daily workflow, starting with reviewing "due today" tasks in their inbox, then checking their acuity dashboard (in Looker) to confirm member due dates (00:01:08).  They check the dashboard multiple times a day to ensure accuracy (00:02:02), and they may contact their supervisor for discrepancies or unusual situations such as a system glitch showing that an attempt wasn't made when it was (00:02:54).  They prioritize tasks based on acuity and urgency, sometimes scheduling check-ins a day or two ahead of the due date for flexibility (00:09:55) (00:11:23).
* Using the Acuity Dashboard and Inbox:  Washington-Freda uses the acuity dashboard and inbox to track member check-ins (00:01:08).  They use the dashboard to check the “next attempt date” for members and use the inbox to follow-up. The acuity dashboard is not always up to date, so they verify information in multiple locations (00:02:02). The regular check-in feature in the inbox provides an additional check that they're not missing anything (00:15:58). A task being in the inbox doesn't always mean it is immediately due (00:19:10).
* Navigating Member Pages and Tasks:  After identifying due members, Washington-Freda accesses their pages and reviews their care plans, checking for upcoming appointments, and reviewing past communications to refresh their memory (00:05:07). They also check for any pending priority tasks, such as completing screening tools (00:05:45).  Reviewing previous interactions helps them remember previous conversations.  The size of their member panel (109) influences their workflow (00:06:42).  They schedule tasks in advance to prevent being overwhelmed by multiple member needs on any single day (00:09:55) (00:12:16). Washington-Freda sometimes combines tasks, such as an acuity check-in and a Transition of Care (TOC) task, into a single interaction to be more efficient (00:13:02).  They use templates for TOC tasks (00:13:53), which usually involve completing specific tools and answering related questions (00:15:01).
* Regular Check-in Tasks and Scheduling: Washington-Freda clarified their understanding of regular check-in tasks, explaining they handle acuity-based tasks differently from other requests.  They don't automatically schedule every task for the next check-in, prioritizing urgent tasks and handling scheduling flexibility (00:08:11).  They prefer to schedule appointments a couple days before the actual due date to account for unexpected issues or busy days (00:09:55).  The acuity dashboard shows when an attempt is due, not when the call must be completed (00:11:23).
* Member Non-Compliance and Workflow Adjustments:  Washington-Freda frequently encounters situations where members refuse to engage with specific tasks. In these cases, they either archive the task or reschedule it for the next check-in, prioritizing what is feasible during the call (00:22:42).  The process often involves prioritizing tasks based on member needs, sometimes leading to unfinished goal pathways in a single conversation (00:23:37).
* 360 Page and Inbox Improvements: Washington-Freda expressed that while they appreciate the additional layers of verification offered by the new inbox features, some aspects of the 360 page are overwhelming.  They find the task section of the 360 page the most useful, while others provide limited value (00:24:28).  While they find the “member impressions” section helpful, they wish it were more prominent (00:25:35).  They use the appointments section more frequently and find it useful for task identification (00:26:28).  The 360 page provides a helpful snapshot of member data but does not always give the full picture necessary for making decisions. Overdue goals, even with current tasks, require further discussions with members (00:27:14).  The additional features in the inbox offer a valuable layer of protection for ensuring attempts are made and aren't missed (00:28:39).  Overall, Washington-Freda finds Commons well-organized and prefers it to other systems. However, they expressed concern that adding too many features could negatively impact efficiency (00:30:28).  The ideal scenario would balance useful features with avoidance of information overload (00:31:28).

Jordan Washington-Freda's biggest takeaway regarding the changes in Commons is that while they appreciate the additional layers of verification offered by the new inbox features, they are concerned that adding too many features could negatively impact efficiency. The ideal scenario, according to Jordan, would balance useful features with avoidance of information overload.


They set due dates with acuity in mind - manually. They know based on acuity how many weeks to schedule a task ahead to, and will adjust to set the due date slightly ahead of the true due date. This helps them feel like they have some flexibility to complete the work instead of waiting until the date something is due and not having enough time to get it done. They didn’t explicitly mention setting anything with a due date of RCI in our conversation.

Jordan / Efrain - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Efrain Calderon: talking. You know what I mean? Um so yeah, I mean if if you're okay with um sharing your screen, I'd love to just kind of talk through um you know, some some of the work you do in comments and stuff. Um
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yep.
Efrain Calderon: and basically, you know, yeah, I'm just curious like how you typically start your day in comments.
Jordan Washington-Freda: um to start my day um I'll usually go to do today uh right off rip I'll go to due today in my inbox and before we had this I would filter for the day um then I'll
Efrain Calderon: Oh, okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: organize them up a little bit um and I'll start picking and prioritizing from here I don't know if that's answering it just let
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: me know if I need to add more detail or not
Efrain Calderon: No,
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: I don't know. That's good. other than
Jordan Washington-Freda: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: like due today.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, yeah. So, right here, like I said, I'll organize them, um, keep them nice and neat, and I will, so I will say that I'll open this and I'll open my dashboard.
 
 
00:01:08
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um because I want to know who's really due for acuity today and not um because for me I put all of my check-ins uh about a week ahead of time just to give myself flexibility. So this I always know that you know um my due today task um you know they might not line up with my acuity. So I'll double check my acuity and I'll have this up
Efrain Calderon: Can you
Jordan Washington-Freda: um
Efrain Calderon: show
Jordan Washington-Freda: when
Efrain Calderon: me
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'm
Efrain Calderon: that
Jordan Washington-Freda: looking at
Efrain Calderon: that
Jordan Washington-Freda: this.
Efrain Calderon: piece? Sorry, I didn't throw up, Jordan.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: The acuity piece. Is that like a dashboard somewhere else or can you show me?
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. So, I'll go into my primary care team dashboard.
Efrain Calderon: And you said that like this lets you know whether someone is actually due or something like that. Can you tell me more about that?
Jordan Washington-Freda: So, right here, um, these are my members minimum engagement. So, uh, next attempt date.
 
 
00:02:02
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So Denise Tom Thompson and um this member right here, they are due the 11th and the 12th. So if I go back to my inbox, I have Denise Thomas and was it James? I'm sorry. Yeah, James Hill. They're right here. But um I will also kind of, you know, just like I said in the morning, I'll kind of just check this out. Who do we got this week right here in these this tab? and I will compare it over here. Uh, a little bit annoying, but I just, you know, I'll check that dashboard at least three times a day in the morning, afternoon, and before I close out just to make sure I'm not missing anything. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Is that Can you go back to the dashboard real quick? Is that um is that refreshing like like almost real time or
Jordan Washington-Freda: so that's you got to be careful someday. You never know if the dashboard is up to date or not, but I know
Efrain Calderon: the
Jordan Washington-Freda: because
 
 
00:02:54
 
Efrain Calderon: object.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I check it every day. I mean, I have like a good enough idea that it's
Efrain Calderon: So,
Jordan Washington-Freda: like
Efrain Calderon: you might remember a name or something
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: that you're like, "Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: I already
Jordan Washington-Freda: Like for instance, like if I'm looking at this today, I only have three due this week, you know? So, like that's I I'll know um Tuesday. I'm like, I have three people due this week. I'm not going to go crazy about it. I'm not going to, you know, worry if it's updated or not. But I mean if a there's an acuity change um
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: you know that's why I also keep up with it and if something looks a little you know odd to me I'll just throw it to my supervisor um
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: and make sure I document
Efrain Calderon: Uh
Jordan Washington-Freda: um
Efrain Calderon: what what would be like an example of something odd like that?
Jordan Washington-Freda: if I know I contacted someone and they're showing in the red that
 
 
00:03:42
 
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: happens.
Efrain Calderon: I got you. Like it would say like no attempt made, but like you know you made an attempt.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. Or if like I made if I made two attempts to Denise yesterday or you know um you know on Friday and it still says they're due. Um I'll wonder why it's not registered. I'll go back make sure that I put the right template and then if I put the right template I'll honestly it does um glitch. It is pretty glitchy. So
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll I don't get too worried about it.
Efrain Calderon: As long as you let someone know. Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, okay. So, I log in, pull up my due today, organize it, kind of just do a brief look through like I know these are acuity, you know, these might be tasks I just got um, you know, left behind or maybe just a research. Um, but, you know, I look at this. I confirm that Denise is due.
 
 
00:05:07
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: confirm that Denise is due and then I'll go to her page and um is that what you're asking? Like how
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: would
Efrain Calderon: Well, I mean the week Yeah, this is exactly right. So, like um how would you get to the nasis page?
Jordan Washington-Freda: So either from here or the D Oh, I'm sorry. So I can click right here, bring up her page.
Efrain Calderon: And that opens it in like another tab.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yep. And
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Jordan Washington-Freda: then um Yeah, I'm I'm sure you want to ask about the 360 page. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Well, only if that's what we use. I mean, like like I said, like a you know, we don't
Jordan Washington-Freda: how
Efrain Calderon: have to
Jordan Washington-Freda: do I
Efrain Calderon: go
Jordan Washington-Freda: do it? Okay,
Efrain Calderon: about
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll keep I'll
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: keep
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: that in mind. So, I come to Denise. Um, she's moderate right away.
 
 
00:05:45
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: I know she's moderate. I'm familiar with Denise. I don't have to do too much dive in. I'll go
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Jordan Washington-Freda: to her care plan. Make sure these are up to date. Um, make sure nothing's expired, overdue. Um, kind of review them quickly. I know her care plan. And I just want to make sure I'm knowing what I'm going to talk about and the questions I'm going to ask. And then I'll look down here, see what uh, you know, maybe prior uh, priority task. You know, I'm going to have to offer her an APV, make sure I complete my screening tools, and then I will go down. Normally, I'll go down, make sure there's no appointments like upcoming today that I forgot of or rescheduled appointment. Then I kind of make my way back up to time uh timeline. Then I go to Okay, I try to follow up on the PCA. Oh, that's right. She called. I'll go down. Okay, yeah, I completed the TOC.
 
 
00:06:42
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll open that. I'll view that. Get my notes. So, I'll just kind of go down our last few connections. Then
Efrain Calderon: So, it's
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: helping you kind of like remember what you all talked about and
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yep.
Efrain Calderon: you also mentioned like you're familiar with um you know this particular member you're looking through the care plan. Uh how big is like your panel of members?
Jordan Washington-Freda: I think it's like 109 I think because
Efrain Calderon: Do you
Jordan Washington-Freda: of
Efrain Calderon: feel like do you feel that way with a lot of members where you're like oh yeah I remember talking to them or
Jordan Washington-Freda: some of them. But
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: it's dangerous to live that way
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Yeah. I got you. So you
Jordan Washington-Freda: because
Efrain Calderon: still
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll
Efrain Calderon: have to
Jordan Washington-Freda: be
Efrain Calderon: do
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll
Efrain Calderon: that.
Jordan Washington-Freda: call John and it's really not John. You know, I'll
 
 
00:07:18
 
Efrain Calderon: I
Jordan Washington-Freda: think it's
Efrain Calderon: got
Jordan Washington-Freda: John.
Efrain Calderon: you.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll be like, "Oh,
Efrain Calderon: You
Jordan Washington-Freda: yeah.
Efrain Calderon: don't want to mix them
Jordan Washington-Freda: Appointment."
Efrain Calderon: up.
Jordan Washington-Freda: So, I try not to do that. But, yeah, there's a there's a good amount of of my members. I'd say I'd say probably a good amount a good a good amount of my members that I'm pretty familiar with. Like Denise, though, is you know, she's one of my closer members, I I guess.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, but yeah, I I do try to follow those steps because, you know, just because like I know Denise, um, I I need to go through the care plan, make sure I'm not forgetting something. That's why I kind of do that.
Efrain Calderon: Um, you know, one thing that we introduced was a way to like set certain tasks due at like regular check-in. And I'm
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: curious whether you think about tasks that way of like this is work I do during regular check-in or this is work I wouldn't do during regular check-in or like I don't know if you've used that kind of thing so far.
 
 
00:08:11
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, so I do have questions about the regular check-in task. Um, it was a little bit tr confusing. So I don't know if it's like when you just said it right there, it kind of made me think of it a bit different than I was told, I guess. Um, so certain so certain things are acuity based and other things are just like, hey, can you call my LTSS? Is that what you're asking? Like I wouldn't mark that task, call the LTSSE to check in. I would mark that task for like tomorrow. Is that what you mean?
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Uh, I mean, sort of. I mean, to be fair, too, D, like I I'm also like I
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: definitely don't know as much about this as you do. So, like it sounds like what you're saying is like there's some things that um that if they're like important enough, like you don't want to set for like the next check-in. Is that kind of what you're saying or?
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll show you here.
 
 
00:09:01
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: so this is their care plan. This is what I work. This is my task. This is what I'm going to ask her about. This is what Denise is working on. So, these are my tasks that I check in on comm every acuity. This is what I'm going over. Some of these tasks, if I offer an ICT meeting once and they decline it, I don't need to put that out to my next. I put that out to next year. So, that necessarily wouldn't go to automated next. Um, this one, another one, if she declines it. Um, you know, or they don't they ask me to call them back. Oh, I have this document. Can you call me back next week? I'm not going to put that test to to next month. I'm going to put that test to next week. That's what I meant. But like in general, yeah. Um I don't mind I would I mean that that seems pretty convenient, I guess, pushing them out.
 
 
00:09:55
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: But then that's another thing. Like I said, I like to put my people ahead um of their due date, even if
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: it's just a couple days
Efrain Calderon: Is
Jordan Washington-Freda: because,
Efrain Calderon: there Yeah. Can you tell me why?
Jordan Washington-Freda: well, if I miss a day, if I get really busy, I have 109 members. So if I'm putting everyone on acuity, that's not going to work. I need to be ahead of it because if I have five members that you know present at an emergency department and I have to follow up with them and then I have you know another major member concern or a meeting. So I like to be ahead of um acuity always at least at bare minimum a day or two but it does happen a lot you know I have if I don't do that I would have a lot more people do on one day you know today I have two
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Jordan Washington-Freda: people do but if I didn't do that I'd probably have like you know you never know I might have 10 people do today along with all these other tasks that I got to complete you
 
 
00:10:51
 
Efrain Calderon: It sounds like part of it is like uh you know you want to make sure you complete it kind of before it's due.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Well,
Efrain Calderon: Is
Jordan Washington-Freda: you
Efrain Calderon: that
Jordan Washington-Freda: don't want to be behind. You don't
Efrain Calderon: you
Jordan Washington-Freda: want to
Efrain Calderon: don't
Jordan Washington-Freda: be
Efrain Calderon: want you behind?
Jordan Washington-Freda: in
Efrain Calderon: And
Jordan Washington-Freda: and then
Efrain Calderon: so if sorry.
Jordan Washington-Freda: No, no, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Efrain Calderon: So is it like cuz like if I would have said it for like let's say the check-in today then is it is the idea that like well if I don't get them today then like I'm going to be overdue tomorrow basically, right? Like is that
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yes.
Efrain Calderon: kind of the the idea? Like, hey, set it a couple days ahead. Then
Jordan Washington-Freda: So
Efrain Calderon: I have
Jordan Washington-Freda: they
Efrain Calderon: some some
Jordan Washington-Freda: have
Efrain Calderon: room.
Jordan Washington-Freda: to Yeah, that dashboard I showed you, that's when the attempt is due.
 
 
00:11:23
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: like
Efrain Calderon: I got
Jordan Washington-Freda: you need to at least have tried to call them by that day.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: So if I call them three days early, they don't answer, but then they call me back the next day. Um they're within that acuity time frame, even though it doesn't matter, just the attempt needs to be. And then I will say that like yeah, I have to be ahead of like I have 109 members. If I'm not ahead of
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: them, then, you know, I'm going to be just running around all day, you know, um
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: all disorganized. So, yeah, if I have if
Efrain Calderon: So
Jordan Washington-Freda: I can, I'll definitely get ahead. Always schedule ahead because then I have the flexibility, too. If I go in my dashboard and they're due in four days and I'm really busy, you know, I might call them even earlier or um I might if they're due in four days, but they're in my my my due today inbox, I can still move them out to tomorrow if I had to.
 
 
00:12:16
 
Efrain Calderon: All right. You have
Jordan Washington-Freda: You
Efrain Calderon: that
Jordan Washington-Freda: know what
Efrain Calderon: option.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I mean? Like if my inbox is five pages long and I'm working and then it's almost five o'clock, I can still push
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: that out till tomorrow. But if I didn't do that, I'd be screwed.
Efrain Calderon: Right. Right. That makes sense. Um,
Jordan Washington-Freda: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: how would you determine like like if you know that you have to do it, you know, a day or two before then, how would you know what day the check-in is?
Jordan Washington-Freda: So if they're moderate, um if their cut is moderate, it's six weeks, I
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: believe. So then I would do five weeks.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Sorry.
Efrain Calderon: So, you're just doing
Jordan Washington-Freda: On a
Efrain Calderon: the
Jordan Washington-Freda: calendar,
Efrain Calderon: math.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I would just go like this.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: And
Jordan Washington-Freda: go
Efrain Calderon: you know
Jordan Washington-Freda: one,
 
 
00:13:02
 
Efrain Calderon: how
Jordan Washington-Freda: two,
Efrain Calderon: many weeks
Jordan Washington-Freda: three, four, five. You know what
Efrain Calderon: do
Jordan Washington-Freda: I mean?
Efrain Calderon: you
Jordan Washington-Freda: And
Efrain Calderon: All right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: then if this is the sixth week, you know, it doesn't have to be on the 12. It could be in the 10th. It could be, you know, it's within that week. That's how I do it at least.
Efrain Calderon: Right. Um, have you have you ever uh run into a situation where like um you shouldn't reach out to someone for a check-in because they have like a TOC that's active.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll do both. I'll
Efrain Calderon: You
Jordan Washington-Freda: do a
Efrain Calderon: do both.
Jordan Washington-Freda: temp I'll do a TOC and my acuity template. Same with MIC. Like if someone has an MI a TOC task like they were just discharged yesterday and then they also were due for acuity today. I'll combine the note.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. This way it'll count for the check-in but also you know you got to do your TOC work itself.
 
 
00:13:53
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. Yeah. because all the TOC needs is this. And then um you know I have my own template right here. So I'll put this in. I'll also do this. And then I'll just kind of make them neat. Make them neater. I'll do this.
Efrain Calderon: So you have a template for the uh for like what you would discuss during a TOC. Do you put that on every member's um scratch pad or is it just like
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, this just happened like she just had a recent one. So, I kind of just copied and pasted it in there
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: and it
Efrain Calderon: cuz
Jordan Washington-Freda: was still
Efrain Calderon: you've
Jordan Washington-Freda: in
Efrain Calderon: got your
Jordan Washington-Freda: my
Efrain Calderon: notes there.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: this is my notepad. So,
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I have my own like to template right here. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Is it that when a TOC happens and again like forgive me if I'm you know I'm not I know kind of a transition care generally but is it like after a TOC uh is there like a set a set like work that you have to do with that member and is it is it something that like someone has to tell you to go do this this this or is it always kind of the same thing?
 
 
00:15:01
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So it's uh if someone's um emergency room, you know, well, yeah,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I won't go too far into detail. So if someone has a COC task and I have to call them, I have to call them and I have to complete this tool. So, it's the
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: same tool. Uh, here it is.
Efrain Calderon: And then you're answering question.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. And you're
Jordan Washington-Freda: So,
Efrain Calderon: asking
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'm just
Efrain Calderon: questions
Jordan Washington-Freda: going down
Efrain Calderon: about
Jordan Washington-Freda: and
Efrain Calderon: it.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'm just answering the same questions. And then when I'm done, it's just yeah, you know, I completed the tool, you know, and just put it that in and I'll put all my task and I'll complete the task. So, I'll kind of loop them in if I if I can.
Efrain Calderon: question. Um, can we go back to the inbox
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah, no problem.
Efrain Calderon: and um, like you were saying how you'll you'll check out due today pretty much.
 
 
00:15:58
 
Efrain Calderon: Um,
Jordan Washington-Freda: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: one thing that like Okay. Um, is there anything you like noticed about the new inbox or ways that it might have changed how you work?
Jordan Washington-Freda: I like I said, I don't let I don't really
Efrain Calderon: All
Jordan Washington-Freda: don't let it change unless I have to. And the only thing that it did for to be honest is I think that um it just gave me another place to confirm that I'm on track.
Efrain Calderon: right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Like I
Efrain Calderon: Um
Jordan Washington-Freda: use the regular check-in. So yeah, the due today, that's that's sweet. I just clicked due today. I mean, that's cool. Um, that's helpful, I guess. Um, and then the regular check-in, you know, that's the only other thing I can see that I made two. Um, and then like for this one, you know, I Sorry, I just clicked it. It says that I'm I didn't make the two attempt. Um, and you know, it's not on the dashboard. She's not on the dashboard, right?
 
 
00:17:08
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So she's at
Efrain Calderon: What
Jordan Washington-Freda: least
Efrain Calderon: is that?
Jordan Washington-Freda: So this member right
Efrain Calderon: Like if they're not on the dashboard, what does that mean?
Jordan Washington-Freda: so again this is saying regular check-ins this is saying this member is due by March 10 right
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Jordan Washington-Freda: when I go to the dashboard she that member sorry at the minimum engagement which is the same as an acuity checkin she's not here, right? So, I would kind of be like, "Wait a minute. Where is she?" I'd look for her name in here, which is a pain, honestly. You can you can filter it. Um, so I'll probably do that just to confirm. Um, I I do know what that issue is, though. It didn't register my template, but I'll just show you. So,
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I just filtered it. I'm going to go to that member and
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: it says that she's not due until April 21st. Okay, that's so I have 40 days to make an attempt.
 
 
00:18:14
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: But this says that she was due. So I guess in that way this is kind of like triggering something to make me look into it. So that's that's helpful, right? I don't want to miss anything. So, I don't know if this is wrong or the dashboard is wrong, but I know that there's an issue. So, like that's how I kind
Efrain Calderon: It
Jordan Washington-Freda: of use these things. It's just like another tool for me to kind of check because my work's not going to change unless like, hey, we're going to use this template now or we're going to make two attempts now, but my work doesn't change. And if you guys give me anything else, it's just something for me to double check. I mean, that's how I generally look at it, I guess. Um but yeah, so again I I go in here and um we have to make two attempts in order for it to count. I made one but I didn't for some reason I I went in there and I tried to add it again as you can see but
 
 
00:19:10
 
Efrain Calderon: Okay, I got you.
Jordan Washington-Freda: successful
Efrain Calderon: It's the
Jordan Washington-Freda: care
Efrain Calderon: template
Jordan Washington-Freda: plan.
Efrain Calderon: thing. Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: So that's showing up overdue.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: The
Jordan Washington-Freda: don't know if this is to you or not but
Efrain Calderon: No, it is this is all this is all helpful, man. It's okay. Um the the due today section in the inbox that so that includes like all of your tasks that are like due today basically, right?
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yes. All the tasks that and by due today it's just what the day like it's not all of them are like you know some of these I don't know if this really matters to you but um like I don't know I don't want to pick out the wrong one or anything. So like Jamesville reschedule request like that doesn't necessarily mean like this was created on the 13th. It's not due March 11th.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Jordan Washington-Freda: You know what I mean? So
Efrain Calderon: You're aiming
 
 
00:20:00
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: I got
Efrain Calderon: for
Jordan Washington-Freda: to kind
Efrain Calderon: it,
Jordan Washington-Freda: of go through these if I was really what I like to do is I like to get ahead of my days
Efrain Calderon: right?
Jordan Washington-Freda: and organize my inbox. They don't want us organizing our inbox too much because you know people get carried away and moving tasks. But I mean, at the same time, I realistically, you know, if I look at that, I'm gonna go James Hill, I reschedule in, you know, off the top of my head, I know, but I'll just show you. Um, you know, I go in, he had one task due today. And oh, wait, no, he had more. That's a bad example. Oh, no. Yeah. So, where is it? 11th. Hold on. Let me go back here real quick. One second.
Efrain Calderon: and
Jordan Washington-Freda: All right. So, that's why I didn't do this. So, again, let me organize them. So, I'll use Kevin.
 
 
00:20:54
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: This one right here. Right. He's just a
Efrain Calderon: uh
Jordan Washington-Freda: single loan.
Efrain Calderon: I don't see the the
Jordan Washington-Freda: Oh,
Efrain Calderon: screen
Jordan Washington-Freda: sorry.
Efrain Calderon: anymore.
Jordan Washington-Freda: So my due today um I have like a straggler right here just like a one class and it's an ICT. ICTs are normally offered upon acuitities. So if he was due for acuity, you know what I mean? All his tasks would be there. Like that one ICT standing out for me. It's either he has a ICT scheduled today that I scheduled for him or it's, you know, kind of disorganized. So I will go into his chart and see if I really have to call him today or there's something I'm missing. Um, and I'll go on his chart. And this is kind of a sucky one, too. He has no care plan. But you get what I'm saying. It's just like there's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: a
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: lot of tasks that are just kind of out there and
 
 
00:21:52
 
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: my job to kind of decipher. Does this need to be done today or can I change this to April 14th with those other tasks?
Efrain Calderon: Right. There might be some things that you're setting it a day. You're setting it early, right, to get some work done, but that's different than some other task due today that might be like due
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: today
Jordan Washington-Freda: And I
Efrain Calderon: today.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I don't generate those tasks. Some tasks I
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: generate.
Efrain Calderon: these are automated, right? On a certain thing happening.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. Anyone can can ask
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: me anything. So yeah.
Efrain Calderon: Um, I have some questions. Um, have a couple more questions real quick.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Let's say a member, like let's say there's a task that a member has um and they refuse to work on that task with you. um what would you do next? Like maybe they want to work on some things, right?
 
 
00:22:42
 
Efrain Calderon: But they're like, "Hey, this particular thing, I don't talk about that. I don't do it. Whatever." Like
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. Um
Efrain Calderon: and
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: like first, does that happen? I guess is what I
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: ask.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Oh my
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: goodness. For
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: sure. I mean,
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Jordan Washington-Freda: yeah, because um there's a lot of reasons that happens, I guess. But
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: um yeah, it happens every single time for me. I'm not the type of person who's gonna um you know every single time I speak to this member you know I'm going to ask the same exact questions every time if you know want to um or like uh I guess I should say offer in scheduling something you know if I'm
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: supposed to offer an annual provider visit um if I offer it to them and they say no I don't want to do that I'm all set then I'll complete it or archive it whatever but if they say um right now is not a good time you know, then I'll push it out and I'll bring it up the next time.
 
 
00:23:37
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: But if you know, there's times where I'll be on the phone for 30 minutes and we don't get to three goal pathways, but we talked about a lot of stuff that, you know, um it's about prioritizing. So, like I don't know, are you looking at
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: this? Yeah. Like I
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I can talk to her about her medication falls and then, you know, we could get Miss Care Cord.
Efrain Calderon: All right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: You know what I mean? because I already know she's with the LTSC and if she wasn't she would let me know or maybe we just didn't get to it today. So, but yeah, and then there's other tasks where it's just like, you know, um can we talk about this? No, now is not a good time. No, I don't want to talk about this. No, I've talked to you guys five times today.
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Happens all the time.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Yeah, that's tough. Um, just to wrap up, I know we've only got a few minutes left.
 
 
00:24:28
 
Efrain Calderon: Um, if you could change like one thing about, you know, inbox or this process or 360 page basically like all this all together.
Jordan Washington-Freda: H um I don't know. I mean, just trying to be fair. I don't know because there's a lot of digging around, but I mean, what else are we going to do, you know? And then when you get to I I think that if you try too hard and you're like um take like the 360 page
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Jordan Washington-Freda: for instance, you know, um and again this is kind of like I'm not even using this negative or positive, but it's just kind of a thought. It's like this is a lot for me, you know what I mean? Like this is a lot for me who's calling them every day. I I I don't need to look at all this all the time, but other people do, you know, like a nurse needs to come in here and boom, they know where to go and, you know, my CTO can track this, but me, I don't need a lot of this stuff.
 
 
00:25:35
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um,
Efrain Calderon: What
Jordan Washington-Freda: this
Efrain Calderon: would you say?
Jordan Washington-Freda: is important. This memory impressions is important and I forget about it a lot. I think that if this was maybe in the center, it might be a little bit easier. Like something little like that. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. I'm curious like of those things like which which sections are most like valuable to you and which ones like you're just kind of
Jordan Washington-Freda: yeah,
Efrain Calderon: not
Jordan Washington-Freda: the task
Efrain Calderon: a lot.
Jordan Washington-Freda: the
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: task. So, off the 360 page,
Efrain Calderon: Yes.
Jordan Washington-Freda: this doesn't really matter to me at all because this isn't giving me the whole picture. This doesn't matter to me cuz this isn't giving me no picture. This is just says it's open. That
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: doesn't mean that she needs it.
Efrain Calderon: Action.
Jordan Washington-Freda: um you know uh this I I can't I gotta stick to the dashboard and the inbox. I can't worry about what this says.
 
 
00:26:28
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um and
Efrain Calderon: You said the impression sometimes you look at it
Jordan Washington-Freda: the
Efrain Calderon: does
Jordan Washington-Freda: impressions
Efrain Calderon: get long. I
Jordan Washington-Freda: like
Efrain Calderon: know.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I wish I look at it every call. I some I don't a lot but I wish I did most times.
Efrain Calderon: How about the uh like the appointments thing above it? Do you ever look at that or is that important?
Jordan Washington-Freda: right here.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I will use this more. I don't I I mean, I haven't noticed it, but I will because like I said, I go 360, I go moderate, then I go care plan, any overdue,
Efrain Calderon: This is where
Jordan Washington-Freda: then
Efrain Calderon: you're
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: seeing
Jordan Washington-Freda: go.
Efrain Calderon: your tasks basically,
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. And then I go, okay. Boom. Because if it shows a task up there, I don't really I'll know. have to do some more digging. But
Efrain Calderon: right?
Jordan Washington-Freda: this could task could be current, but the goal could be overdue.
 
 
00:27:14
 
Efrain Calderon: How does that change things if like the task
Jordan Washington-Freda: So
Efrain Calderon: is current,
Jordan Washington-Freda: like,
Efrain Calderon: the goal?
Jordan Washington-Freda: so say this goal was say this goal was for 33 325, right? Say it's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: overdue, but my task is for the 11th, but this is overdue. I don't know if you know what I mean. like if this task is over is the goal is overdue but my task is current and I don't know is this task on that 360 page you know what if this task is a overdue goal I mean that's
Efrain Calderon: Does that change what you do next? Like I'm just cur because
Jordan Washington-Freda: yeah
Efrain Calderon: I just don't know
Jordan Washington-Freda: if
Efrain Calderon: the
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: process.
Jordan Washington-Freda: had if it was overdue I would have to have a discussion with the member on whether you know it's completed whether it's not you know we'd have to have a
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: discussion
Efrain Calderon: okay. Basically, yeah. Yeah.
 
 
00:28:02
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So, like again, that doesn't mean that that's bad. Like, it's just I wouldn't go off of just this. This is kind of just a snapshot. I guess you're
Efrain Calderon: It's
Jordan Washington-Freda: using
Efrain Calderon: not
Jordan Washington-Freda: it
Efrain Calderon: giving
Jordan Washington-Freda: like
Efrain Calderon: you that full
Jordan Washington-Freda: this is what
Efrain Calderon: the
Jordan Washington-Freda: I got to
Efrain Calderon: full
Jordan Washington-Freda: work
Efrain Calderon: picture.
Jordan Washington-Freda: on. Yeah. But it's just like
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: these are all over the place. So, VNA, LTSC, sexual, like, no, let's keep it together. Medication.
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: VNA. VNA. Hey, have you been taking your medication? You still have your VNA? Okay. You know, and then you're
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: like, oh, okay. How about false? You still going to PT? But if I'm like here, that that's not really helping me in a conversation. It's like, do you have a VNA?
 
 
00:28:39
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Do you go PT? Do you do this? So, I wouldn't use it like that.
Efrain Calderon: I got
Jordan Washington-Freda: You
Efrain Calderon: you.
Jordan Washington-Freda: know what I mean?
Efrain Calderon: Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You've got to
Jordan Washington-Freda: But
Efrain Calderon: I mean the conversation is basically how you
Jordan Washington-Freda: but the most important is the moderate, the appointments, the goals are, but I go I rather go to the care plan. And then the member impression is very useful if I, you know, need it. the P the the changes to the inbox you said like that
Efrain Calderon: I guess inbox or 360 al together if you could think of it or if you think one is making it harder, one is making it easier, we could split it off too, however you
Jordan Washington-Freda: uh it's it's so I think that um it might be a a bit too soon. I think that um I I think like I said, anything that's going to offer me more protection, I like it. So that extra layer of like let me go here and make sure I had two calls, I like it.
 
 
00:29:42
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: And then I will
Efrain Calderon: like
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: the
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: protection meaning like it's just it's another spot that's let you know how many how
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'm
Efrain Calderon: many
Jordan Washington-Freda: not
Efrain Calderon: attempts
Jordan Washington-Freda: get
Efrain Calderon: were
Jordan Washington-Freda: behind.
Efrain Calderon: made on a thing
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'm not
Efrain Calderon: that's
Jordan Washington-Freda: going to get behind because now I have like the dashboard, my check, my due today, and I also have my regular check-in. I can combine those. to make sure I'm not behind. And not only that, I can make sure now that we have to make two calls, I can see that I actually made two attempts. You know, the dashboard doesn't show that I made it just removes it or it's red. You know, either I did it or I didn't. Um
Efrain Calderon: Hey,
Jordan Washington-Freda: the regular check-ins, that's cool. Like, you know, I do like that. Uh, I guess now that I'm thinking about it more, it's like, you know, I can make sure that I did two attempts and if I have one attempt and I can go in there and do it.
 
 
00:30:28
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, and and then I I will say to be honest, like I have worked at a lot of places and I I do like Commons by far the most. Like just Commons in general, I do like it the most out of every other one I've used. it it is um pretty well organized and and just useful in general to me. Like I don't even think anything really needs to change. I think it it was good how it was. And I mean, yeah, I think these improvements make sense. I just wouldn't want to see things get carried away because CHPs, you know, we have to like fish through for all this stuff. A nurse only needs certain things. We have to have everything. And it's just like a lot of these just get like, you know, you're going from this page to that page to this page and then you have 109 people. So
Efrain Calderon: Can you can you tell me more of that? Cuz you said like carried away and I'd love I know it sounds silly but like can you like like can you um talk me through like what it would be like?
 
 
00:31:28
 
Efrain Calderon: Like let's say let's say they got carried away. What would that look like to you?
Jordan Washington-Freda: to like like when I f like like I said, you know, my the first opinion from I think everybody probably like in my role it's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: just looking is just too much. there's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: just too much stuff like
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: um that's just unnecessary for me right now. I mean, yeah, it's important stuff, but it's just like, you know, that could be a thing. It's just like, whoa. Like, when I first looked at this, it took me a while to even know what I was looking at when I first
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: started. I don't know what what all this is.
Efrain Calderon: How long How long have you been at um sleep for? About
Jordan Washington-Freda: Over a year. Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: Nice. It goes
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: by quick, right?
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. for sure. It has.
 
 
00:32:14
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: It has definitely flown by.
Efrain Calderon: When I hit my year, I was like, "Oh, wow. I didn't think about it, you know, but
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah, it flew by honestly. But,
Efrain Calderon: I
Jordan Washington-Freda: you know,
Efrain Calderon: uh
Jordan Washington-Freda: busy work, so
Efrain Calderon: well, you know, definitely with that in mind, I don't want to keep take too much of your time because you've already been super generous with it. Um, but I'm just, you know, before before I let you go, I wanted, you know, one, I wanted to know if there was anything that we we should talk about that we haven't talked about yet that's important to this that you want to bring up.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah, I don't think so. I guess I just want to reiterate that like I said, I don't think I'm the best person to kind of like get get anything from. Maybe I am. I you know, um I guess overall if you take a bunch of people like I guess that's the idea. Um but
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, exactly. Yeah,
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: because
Jordan Washington-Freda: don't
Efrain Calderon: I mean
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: there's lots of people that will step up and say like this is the way we should do it. Um

Summary
Sarah Kaluhiokalani reviewed Commons' daily workflow, 360-page feedback, and task management, highlighting frustrations with the interface design, specifically unsuccessful call attempts, the 360 page's appointment display, and the "upcoming and overdue tasks" panel.  Key issues included a cluttered inbox, lack of CHP filtering, and inaccurate on-hold statuses.  Her top priority is removing unsuccessful call attempts after two tries to improve workflow efficiency.


Details
* Daily Workflow and User Experience: Sarah Kaluhiokalani described their daily workflow in Commons, highlighting frustrations with the regular check-in panel's design and the display of unsuccessful call attempts (00:00:54) (00:03:21). They expressed a strong preference for a cleaner interface, suggesting that unsuccessful attempts should disappear after two tries (00:00:54) (00:02:29), and that filtering by CHP would improve team task management (00:03:21).  They also noted that they don't use the to-do list feature, preferring the inbox as their task manager (00:04:53).  The current system was described as "cluttered" and "overwhelming,"  leading to a feeling that they are "becoming more scammy" in their outreach efforts (00:00:54) (00:02:29).
* 360 Page Feedback:  Kaluhiokalani provided feedback on the 360 page, specifically the appointments section. They found the current display of appointments unhelpful, preferring more specific information, such as the dates of last and next scheduled APV and HRA appointments, which they personally track (00:07:43).  They noted that the "next check-in date" feature is helpful (00:05:50).  The "open quality gaps" section was described as less useful due to their non-clinical role (00:06:48).  The on-hold status in the regular check-in and due sections caused distrust in the system's accuracy and reliability, as the system doesn't always correctly reflect the on-hold status (00:09:56) (00:14:34).
* Task Management and Archiving: Kaluhiokalani explained their task management process, emphasizing their preference for tasks within the context of care plan goals (00:21:48).  They described how they handle incomplete tasks, often editing or archiving them depending on the member's engagement and the task's relevance (00:24:25). Archiving a task signifies that it cannot be completed for a specified reason (00:25:52). They create personalized tasks tailored to their workflow and their interaction with members (00:27:28).  They expressed dislike for the "upcoming and overdue tasks" panel, finding it redundant and lacking context within the care plan (00:21:48).
* Suggested Improvements and Overall Assessment: Kaluhiokalani's top priority for improvement was removing unsuccessful call attempts from the inbox after two attempts (00:28:15).  This was emphasized due to its negative impact on workflow, especially for CHPs with larger caseloads. They rated the overall impact of the recent changes as a "two" on a scale of one to five, with one being minimal impact and five being significantly harder (00:32:39). While they acknowledged some improvements, such as easier access to who's assigned to what in the inbox compared to the dashboard, the inability to filter the inbox by CHP remained a significant issue. The loss of the dashboard's filtering capabilities made finding information more difficult, especially when team members are out of office (00:31:08).  The 7-day rolling view of regular check-ins was also described as unhelpful, as it gives a continuous sense of incompletion and doesn't provide the closure of finishing tasks within a work week (00:17:58).

Efrain Calderon: I guess it's just working now. Okay, cool. Um, and then I may have questions like sometimes when I'm kind of reviewing some of the answers and stuff, I'll be like, "Oh, um, you know, I should have asked this or like I wonder what about this, so I might reach out with some additional questions later
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: on."
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No.
Efrain Calderon: All right. So, um, I guess like before we dive in, I'd love to just hear about like how you like usually start your day in commons.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, so do you want me to just share my screen? I feel like that's easier.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: sure. Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: See, it's a little uh
Efrain Calderon: Totally.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: easier to do than to describe it. Uh, so I've start now I start in my regular check-in panel to see kind of what I have due for the day, which I have like mixed feelings about it. Um, I guess I missed the dashboard.
 
 
00:00:54
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I mean, the dashboard is still here, but mine got really messed up because they added me as a primary for everybody, so that was not really helpful. Um, so this is fine. I mean, for me, it's not so bad. As a senior CHP, I only have um 50 members, 50 to 60 members, so this isn't terrible. I won't generally have as many due during the course of the day. Um, but then I'll also check in on my team, and I mean, this is just like overwhelming to look at, honestly. Um, I hate it. So, and it's not incredibly helpful for me or for anyone, I don't think, because one, I would I would really love to see like when these two attempts are made that this goes away. I mean, I understand that the idea is, "Oh, maybe you'll try again." I promise you, I'm not going to try again.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: We are calling people so much right now, it's obnoxious.
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: If I call a member twice and they don't answer, I'm I'm never I'm not calling them again.
 
 
00:01:49
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I wouldn't call them again, you know, after the first try because it's like if they don't want to talk to me, they're not going to pick up. But now I'm going to hound them and I know if somebody does that to me personally, I'm not going back. So,
Efrain Calderon: So it's
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: um,
Efrain Calderon: so it sounds like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: yeah,
Efrain Calderon: it's less about um not even Yeah. I mean the way you're Yeah. Yeah. Is it just a um is it a matter of calling someone and you've made an attempt and they're not they're kind of like not interested or they're not kind of like ready for the regular check-in and you're calling or um like the scenario you're messing like where you're kind of bothering people, right? Which which is definitely a concern. Is it that they're picking up and they're like, "H, I don't want to do this right now." Or is it like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: These
Efrain Calderon: you just
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: are
Efrain Calderon: can't reach?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah, these are unsuccessful attempts.
 
 
00:02:29
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Like for even for my member who I called this morning and I have to call her again, which I
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: just feel like it's rude. Like I didn't if they didn't pick up before, it's either because they couldn't or they didn't want to talk to me right now. Like I have a really good relationship with this member and I know that when she needs something, she's going to call me because that's how it's been. But now I I didn't get her. said, "I'm going to call her again." And it just feels like we're becoming more scammy and more like, "Ah, you're you have to talk to me today. It's very, you know, like you're just a number to me that I need to make." And
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I because I don't want to be treated that way.
Efrain Calderon: gotcha. That makes sense. Um, you mentioned the my care team to you there.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, it's not pretty much no like if these two attempts are done, I would like to see them like leave the like they should be gone.
 
 
00:03:21
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: They should be out of the the inbox because nobody's
Efrain Calderon: option.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: going to nobody's calling that person again. I'm telling you, they're not. Um, this is a little bit not I mean, obviously I'm not stupid and I can see like this is a task and this is attempt, but like it's just so cluttered and so much to look at. Um, but then I would really like to see this have a filter on it so that you can filter by CHP because
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like let's say you're in my role and hey like Nicole just calls out today and I have to go see who she has due can you tell me which one of these is Nicole's because I can't you know like so it's annoying to not be able to like when I had the dashboard I could go okay you know Nicole has these three members due today so I can call those three members for her but instead I got to do all these jump around and hoops and like who does she have assigned to herself and like what tasks blah blah blah So it's
 
 
00:04:08
 
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: just a little bit annoying that way. So I I
Efrain Calderon: Is it
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: really like that.
Efrain Calderon: is that it that you'd have to be looking for like the task assigning me and like kind of
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: I guess
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Like
Efrain Calderon: you could do it that way or
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I would have I would literally have to come in and then I filter my inbox for pod five and then I have to go who is it assigned to and you know so if it was just in here like hey these three people
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: are due for acuity today and they're Nicole's members then I know I have to
Efrain Calderon: sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: call those three people. So
Efrain Calderon: Um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that helpful.
Efrain Calderon: yeah, that makes a lot of sense. That's good to know. You know, the other thing um well, that you're already giving me such great uh feedback, which is awesome. Um I'd like to So, you you said you start your day kind of like on your I guess on the primary view, is that right?
 
 
00:04:53
 
Efrain Calderon: Like you'll be in that regular check-in or how do you usually like what's the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: first
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So,
Efrain Calderon: um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'll come in and
Efrain Calderon: folder?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'll I'll look at my regular check. I don't use the to-do list. I don't know what the point of that is. I think my inbox is my to-do list.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, I don't know what it's for. I don't know what people do with it. I literally do not use it. So, I there's nothing on it. So, I go to my regular check-in to see, you know, now how many attempts do I need to make for these people? And then I spend a lot of time mostly in the due today for my tasks because that's that's to me that's
Efrain Calderon: Peace.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: my to-do list. That's what I have to do today. So, I like to filter mine to include the uh really understand the point in separating them. Um, it's not helpful and they're more likely to get missed, I think, if I'm not checking to see what else I need to um work from here.
 
 
00:05:50
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, then I usually have multiple tabs open and I'll be like, "Okay, so I got to call Gan." And then I'll I'll open up a separate common chart. Um, and I'll go to call her. Um, I don't won't spend a lot of time on the 360 page because it's
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: not useful to me. Um, really I mean I now I do enjoy that they have like the next check-in date here. That's that's helpful.
Efrain Calderon: Can you show me that?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um,
Efrain Calderon: I had some questions about
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: but
Efrain Calderon: the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: then
Efrain Calderon: 360
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'll
Efrain Calderon: page as well.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. So, this is their 36 little box. Let me just I'm sorry. One my ever since I updated my computer today, it's been running like absolute garbage. I don't know what happened.
Efrain Calderon: Oh, I'm
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's
Efrain Calderon: sorry.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: running like trash.
Efrain Calderon: Most of it's getting through, but um you know what?
 
 
00:06:48
 
Efrain Calderon: Let me Is it okay if I drop video? Maybe that helps. I don't know if that helps
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: bandwidth.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: sometimes
Efrain Calderon: All right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it does.
Efrain Calderon: Sorry.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No,
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that's okay. Um, so yeah, so we've got the next check-in date due, which is which is nice. That was never something we like really had easy access to. Massachusetts, but the acuity is important. The open quality gaps something that I I'm not a clinical person. So in Massachusetts, we're I think different than everywhere else because we
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: don't we don't do the DIAD. like it's just me in this chart unless the members in like the TOC workflow and the nurses in here but it's really just me. So I think we're trying to work like focus on this a
Efrain Calderon: He
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: little bit because I guess it is our responsibility because it's just us. Um but I don't really I don't spend a ton of time in here.
 
 
00:07:43
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um but I you know I understand why it's important. Um
Efrain Calderon: How
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: go
Efrain Calderon: about
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: ahead.
Efrain Calderon: the um there's a section there that says appointments. Can you tell me whether that's been useful, not useful, neutral?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, I would find it more useful if it was much more specific to what appointments. Like if this member has an appointment with the I don't really need that information here. I don't think that's helpful.
Efrain Calderon: I'm sorry, you cut out a little bit. I want to make sure I
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um
Efrain Calderon: get it. You said
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: or
Efrain Calderon: if the member had an appointment with
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: um like the he had like a mic. I think he probably has one.
Efrain Calderon: Sorry, it's cut out again. What What kind of appointment? It's just really important for me.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'm sorry. Is that better? Maybe with
Efrain Calderon: I don't know possibly, but um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Okay. Um so like this member had like if this member has an upcoming phone call, I I don't need to know that.
 
 
00:08:45
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's something that I can very easily check in the appointment with Andrew on, you know, what day. For me, it would be more helpful if it showed the last APV and then I I guess when the next one is due and then the last or HA appointment and when the next one is due
Efrain Calderon: Is that be
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like
Efrain Calderon: Is that because you helped schedule those or
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yes.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So the ones that I schedule are the ones that I I mean I manually track them for every one of my members if it could be something that was auto was when the next one's due. I think um right now like for our HAS are the ones that like the m the I think that we schedule and we have to like really go into the chart to find out when the last one was when the next one is due having it here would be much more of like
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: so this I mean it's possibly you know useful but not incredibly useful the way that it is
 
 
00:09:56
 
Efrain Calderon: Um, have you ever noticed um where the rci kind of on the top left is that it would say on hold?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Was it Dian? Oh no, maybe it was Mary. Oh, so Debbiey's Oh god, it's so slow. This was on hold. Hold on. Okay, that's weird. Mary, it was this morning. I want to say that it was this morning. Um, yeah. Okay, so this one is So, Mary's is on hold because she's in the TOC workflow right now, which is I guess that's the brand new thing that they just started. Um, which is okay. Um, I have like questions about it, I guess.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. What What kind of questions come up about that?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So my question
Efrain Calderon: I don't
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I
Efrain Calderon: know
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: guess
Efrain Calderon: questions.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: dumb question. So So I had a member who was Diane. So she was on hold for now I have an appointment scheduled with her this Thursday.
 
 
00:11:28
 
Efrain Calderon: Thank you.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Well, my question is like if we then I set her acuity for moderate, but now once she's done with showing on hold anymore and I'm not really sure why, but once she's done with her TOC workflow, like I really shouldn't have to call her for another six weeks because I'm literally doing a visit with her. But then is it going to set her acuity due date to 5 days after then? That just seems silly.
Efrain Calderon: Is there a different cadence that you probably set that at or have that be set at after um like the TOC event ends?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So I I mean right now what we used to do was once a member went inatient their acuity would be set to critical. So we had
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: to do a a care plan review every two weeks which is just obnoxious. There's no reason to do that. So they put it on hold now and I don't really see the point now in even making
Efrain Calderon: SP
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: them critical because once you're in the TOC workflow you're going to get weekly to call.
 
 
00:12:29
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So it's not like you need another reminder to call the member for acuity. You're going to be calling them anyway. So once she's done with whatever happened, she should really revert back to her acuity from before. Unless something wildly is, you know, is different and it's like, well, she really does need me to call her every two weeks or every month, then of course we could set it that way, but there's really no reason for me to now because of the fact that we have anyway. So it's just kind of
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: redundant. I mean I am glad that they happened is like let's say I called
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Diane today and then tomorrow she goes inatient. The nurse is now changing her to critical which makes me immediately because it's going basity checkin. So let's say I called her, you know, five weeks ago and she's not due until next week, but as soon as she gets made to critical, I'm So it really helps with that because that was just filling CHP metrics for no reason.
 
 
00:13:37
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's it. See how it goes after. it hasn't been running long enough, I guess for me to see I,
Efrain Calderon: Sarah, I'm still I'm still getting a lot of cut out. I'm wondering if maybe do you
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Do.
Efrain Calderon: think you could try exiting the meeting and then maybe like just re-entering sometimes? I found that can help help with me.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: Um, sorry. I just want to make sure I I
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Oh
Efrain Calderon: get
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: no.
Efrain Calderon: your your
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Oh
Efrain Calderon: feedback, you
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: yeah.
Efrain Calderon: know. All right, let's let's give it a shot. See if
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: it helps. All right, I'll see you in a little.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: We'll
Efrain Calderon: All right, let's let's try this.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: try it video off though. Okay, let's try it again.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, so far so good. We'll see.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I don't know what morning is running like trash today.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
 
 
00:14:34
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I don't know why.
Efrain Calderon: Um,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, I don't know
Efrain Calderon: now
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: where we
Efrain Calderon: when
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: were.
Efrain Calderon: when things are on hold in the in the uh regular check and due, we still show the like due date and the attempt count and stuff. Do you feel any way about that? That's what I'd ask very generally.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I mean, it feels gonna find out like was really on hold. I mean, I don't think anybody trusts that the system's going to work because we get screwed by it. All the his attempts weren't made or if they don't make another attempt for this one, even though he's on hold. I'm assume like we're I guess hoping that after March 10th passes that they're not going to be past due, but I just don't I don't trust it.
Efrain Calderon: You don't trust the So like if if you didn't see the due date and it just said on hold, you wouldn't trust it. Is that what you're saying?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. So, like this is saying that they're due like de her acuity now.
 
 
00:15:37
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It says it's on hold workflow, but come tomorrow, am I going to walk into Deborah showing that she's passed due? We don't know.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: We don't know yet. We don't know yet because this has just happened this week. So, I don't know. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, from what I understand, I think it does kick it forward a few days, but I I want to say like five, but I think you mentioned that too that that might not necessarily be helpful either. That check-in date to to be that soon after like a TOC event, I think is
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: well,
Efrain Calderon: kind of
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: so
Efrain Calderon: what you
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like,
Efrain Calderon: were
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: so what I meant for that was like, so this one is not showing on hold anymore. I don't know why. I she is still in the TOC workflow. So I don't know why it's showing that she's on she's not on hold anymore. So she so now on this Thursday we have a visit scheduled with her spent Lana the nurse practitioner.
 
 
00:16:28
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: We're going to see her in person. Um at that point you know she should be good for the next 6 weeks. But now if her TOC event ends like when this is done say well in 5 days you have to call her again even though she's really moderate and she doesn't need another phone call. So I guess we'll see cuz you know it's too new to have happened. So I don't know yet.
Efrain Calderon: Um, can we go back to the inbox and just have some more questions there? So,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: you know, one question I had, um, I know you mentioned sort of like how you generally, um, filter the check-in tasks back in, right, in those folders that, um, like filter them out by default. Is that right? Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: That would be help. I don't love this like two attempts looks very similar to one task, you know. So, I don't really like connecting in tasks because I just feel like to look at
 
 
00:17:58
 
Efrain Calderon: Sorry, you kind of cut out a little bit again. So, you you don't like looking at I know you I kind of got that you said they look very similar, but then um Yeah. What was after that?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. So, I just don't I don't really see the like why they need to be there. Like why does it even tasks assigned to that member? I we can assume if we're calling the member for acuity, they have tasks
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that are due. So, I just don't think I think it's like superfluous.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I don't think we need it.
Efrain Calderon: Um, and you know, the other thing is that we have this sort of filter, I guess, on the regular check-in where it'll show you things within 7 days and overdue. Um, and I'm just curious
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: whether like it's useful to see seven days of work of regular check-ins or is there a better way or I don't know.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I I would rather because come Friday, like last week, it was almost disappoint.
 
 
00:18:53
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It was like the end of Friday, I want to see that everything's out of my inbox. I did everything.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's like, you
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: know, seven days. It's just it's never done. Like there's always people like a little nerve-wracking like, well, was I supposed to have
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: called that person? You know, like on first. So, it's I don't love that. I wish it was just Monday to Friday
Efrain Calderon: So, it sounds like um possibly you're you're good about keeping your email inbox to zero as well. Like kind of like that that feeling of like, okay, cool. I've I've
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: accomplishment.
Efrain Calderon: done my work for the week,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: right?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Like it just it never it doesn't and maybe it's just like just me but it just doesn't feel good.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Like come
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: come the end of the week I want there to be every I did everything it's done and it's you never get that feeling.
 
 
00:19:42
 
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. No, I can see how that would be um kind of disheartening, especially at the end of the week. Um,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. And I only have again like 50 members. RCHPs have 110 members. The care coordinator has up to two
Efrain Calderon: wow.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: nightmare list. And you know, which is another reason why I would really like to see once these two attempts are made,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: get them out of the inbox because it just it's overwhelming. Who did I not make an attempt on yet? you know, so it's just a lot
Efrain Calderon: And
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: of people
Efrain Calderon: um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: in the
Efrain Calderon: can
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: inbox
Efrain Calderon: we pop into
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: all
Efrain Calderon: a member like 360 page back in there?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: Um and like we were talking about this briefly, but would love to hear in your words like the things you like or dislike about any of the changes.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like the regular check-in date being there.
 
 
00:20:37
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Uh this see appointments being very like specific appointments. It doesn't need to be every
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: appointment like the annual the annual provider visit important visit important the H important
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that they have a phone call with pharmacist not really important
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: you know it just doesn't I don't need to know that it's very easy for me to go in here it look because the things that I'm tracking
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: those three visits it's the HR the APV and the TOC so if I'm trying to find out when the last time this member had an APV It's not I know
Efrain Calderon: Hey
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: because it's I keep track. It's more difficult to go very specifically for an APV or HR or the IC. So I think those three dates would be more useful than just all of these every dates. Um I like what the that's nice. Um I like that they put that back on. That's new. They they had taken the team off.
 
 
00:21:48
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So that's um I don't use this panel at all. The upcoming and overdue tasks. It's not useful. I hate
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it
Efrain Calderon: Can you tell me why?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: because there's no point in looking at it there. There's I'm going to go into the care plan. I'm going
Efrain Calderon: And
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: to look at look at the care plan. See if there's anything overdue. See if there's any what do I have to do for this member today? There's no point to me just looking at this random ta list of tasks because there's no context to it. There's no like, well, what does this mean? You like, what goal am I working on here? You know, so I still need to go and see if the goals are going to expire. So, I still need to go in the care plan anyway.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. Yeah. So, it sounds like the value like your tasks mean a lot more if they're in the context of a goal.
 
 
00:22:34
 
Efrain Calderon: So, when you just list them out like that, it's not really as valuable.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's not at all. And
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it just takes up so much. I'd rather see this primary care team member come right back up here because when I'm assigning out things, you know, cuz I take care of the queue like the and the um incoming whatever queue when I go to a member's chart, I need to know who am I assigning that task to. So, it's nice to know who the primary is and I can find the rest of the team very easily if I really need to. But having that quick information here would be more helpful than having all these tasks here for sure.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, that makes that makes sense. um going up to the uh you know we've got the regular check-in due date and we have the number of attempts but I mean maybe you know this but it the the check-in cadence will sort of change depending on different factors right
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It'll
 
 
00:23:24
 
Efrain Calderon: um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: on their acuity. Okay.
Efrain Calderon: yeah and so what I'm curious is whether it'd be valuable for you to see that anywhere like um I mean you may know this just because you've been working through this right like how many days between if there's such and such acuity or such and such track.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: But
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I mean I could see that being useful for especially for new people who are just you like trying to figure out what what does moderate mean? Like how often am I calling? So yeah, that you know I could see like regular attempt due 421 and then you know
Efrain Calderon: number of attempts or
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: attempt
Efrain Calderon: something
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: by
Efrain Calderon: saying like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like attempt
Efrain Calderon: x
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: by
Efrain Calderon: amount.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: yeah
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like 40 you know 42 days or whatever it is um or attempt due in 42 days or something like that or however many it is.
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Um let's for this next sort of like question slashtask um that I'd love to see you perform I guess is like um well you mentioned that you usually will look at tasks um on the care plan.
 
 
00:24:25
 
Efrain Calderon: So
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: if you if you want to go there um let's imagine there was a task that you couldn't complete either because the member refused or like you know they just weren't interested in doing that. I'm just curious like what you would do next with that task.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So I mean the tasks themselves are I make them. So I make them so that I can complete them I guess. Um, so I I tell myself what I'm doing next time. So it'll be, you know, check on this, check on that, whatever. But when the nurses create their care plans, sometimes the tasks don't make sense. It'll say like sometimes they'll write, you know, check in with member weekly on blood sugar. Meanwhile, that's not something we're doing. Like I'm not calling anybody weekly ever. So
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I will uh edit the I'll just edit the task to say, you know, check in for acuity or whatever it is. Um, if let's say I I'm talking to Diane and she says, "I don't want to work on my my gastrointestinal. I
 
 
00:25:22
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: don't want to work on this anymore. Like, I'm good. We don't need to keep talking about it." I would archive the goal.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, it's not something
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Hey,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: she
Efrain Calderon: don't
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: wants.
Efrain Calderon: don't do don't
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'm
Efrain Calderon: do
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: not
Efrain Calderon: that
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: going
Efrain Calderon: for
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: to do
Efrain Calderon: real.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it now, but it's just ruin my whole care plan. But, it'll be a reason. It'll be say, "Why do you want to archive?"
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: And it's, you know, member doesn't want to work on it or whatever. Um, but
Efrain Calderon: Would
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: the
Efrain Calderon: there
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: task
Efrain Calderon: ever Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like
Efrain Calderon: Would there ever be a case where you'd have to like, you know, no long that a task would no longer be either not started or completed or in progress or anything
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Uh
Efrain Calderon: like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I
Efrain Calderon: that?
 
 
00:25:52
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: mean there definitely could be like sometimes they'll the errands will make it to like they they have the autopop populated tasks that come in with each of the goals like you know refer to nutritionist or something like that and the members like I don't want to go to a nutritionist. Um, so I would either in my know right you know like hey we talked about it they don't want to so I would complete the task but now we have the option to archive it and we can say you know member doesn't want to work on that or whatever the case is that the reason why we're archiving that specific task. We never had that before.
Efrain Calderon: And um do you know what that like if you had to explain to someone Let's say I'm new on the team. Like what does it mean to archive something?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So it just means that there's a reason why we're basically cancelelling the task. like why why are we not going to be able to complete it?
Efrain Calderon: Have you taken a look at those reasons by any chance?
 
 
00:26:39
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I think so.
Efrain Calderon: I'm just curious if you got like a like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: if you took a look at that. I'd just love your reaction on just like the reasons if any of them
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: this is fine. Um permanent I mean I usually I don't really archive my this is new this is a new feature for us.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, so let's say we're doing inbound, one of the inbound comms, you know, questions and we have to make we have to make three attempts to call the member back for whatever it is they called in for. So if I'm not able to get in touch with the member, I would archive I would really archive the whole workflow, but I could archive
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that task and say, you know, couldn't be reached for this specific task. Um, permanent resident of LTC facility. I don't know why that would mean I can't reach them, but all right. Or task no longer applies. You know, it could be, you know, member doesn't want a nutritionist.
 
 
00:27:28
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Test doesn't apply. So, I'm going to I'm going to get rid of it that way. Um, if member,
Efrain Calderon: Gota.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: you know, doesn't want to talk to me, then I would archive my tasks to outreach the member because they don't want to. Um, disenroll.
Efrain Calderon: But it sounds like based on what you were saying like normally you're not archiving tasks. you're just sort of like solving that most of the tasks that you see would be either connected to a workflow or a goal and so then you just sort of address that. Is
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Right.
Efrain Calderon: that right?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. So I mean like again I create my except for the when the nurses create it initially for the care plan when they make the care plan I make my tasks. So every so on March 13th I'm going to ask her like what's your blood pressure been
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like? Are you still taking your medications? Is it still this? And then when we talk about it I'm going to complete it.
 
 
00:28:15
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'm gonna duplicate it and I'm going to do it again next week or next, you know, next year. So, I make it very tailored to myself
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: um because it's kind of helpful for me to know, well, how am I helping the member with that goal? So, I
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: make it very specific for myself. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Cool. Um I know we're at time. I just have a couple more questions if you don't mind. It's not that much longer. Um I guess like yeah, if you could change one thing about all these updates that have kind of rolled out, what would be that change?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: um, get rid of when these attempts are made, get them out of the car and get them out of here.
Efrain Calderon: And if you had to say if you had to say why, like I know you kind of explained it, but like I don't know like why why would that be? And this is all anonymous and like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Oh, I
 
 
00:29:03
 
Efrain Calderon: I
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: don't
Efrain Calderon: don't
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: care.
Efrain Calderon: know what
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'll tell everybody I hate it. Uh, I don't care
Efrain Calderon: fair.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: because it just doesn't need to be there. Like once
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it's done, like I And the thing is like if if this members do like there are members that we've called already ahead of time, right? So
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like let's say that I'm calling this member because they called me and I'm calling them back and now I'm going to try my acuity because I'm trying to get back in touch with them. We have members who are like squirrely. Like they call in like, "Oh, I need to talk to you." And then you call them back and they don't answer the phone. Like, "Okay,
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: well,
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: don't call me." Uh, but I'm not calling them again next week. I I did
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: my time. You're like, "I did my time. I
 
 
00:29:39
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: tried." Like, get it get it out of get it out of the inbox because then it's just clogging up the inbox. And again, this not bad for me because I have 50 members, but for my care team, this is
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: a this is a nightmare to look at. You know, Kim has 200 members. She probably has, you know, 10 people do every day. So, I mean, she's going
Efrain Calderon: Wow.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: to just be looking at like a non-stop. And then if she's trying to go ahead and plan for say vacation, like I have, we have a CHP that's planning to be away for 3 weeks. So, she's trying to like call all these people ahead of time, her inbox is probably a nightmare because she's got to like, oh, she's made these two attempts, but now she's got to weed through and see who well, who else did I not make an attempt on? And, you know, so it's just it's a little obnoxious. Like, it can go away.
 
 
00:30:21
 
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's a lot. It's a lot to look at.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. And then sort of on that sort of related right the same thing of how it's um sort of this rolling 7-day thing.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: It never reduces. Um, so would you say the changes have improved your workflow with regular check-ins? Um, haven't made much of a change or have been neutral to it or have made it harder.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, harder because now we have to make two attempts for every time which is just obnoxious. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I don't I mean I know it's part of the gig. it's what we do. But most of us for the most part, we don't have a lot of members that are not we're not connecting with. So like having to make that extra outreach could just be really like I don't know would make me hate. I wouldn't want to talk to me either. Don't call me twice. That's rude. Um I don't know.
 
 
00:31:08
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's just rude. But I mean I I again I do like
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that it's it's here. It's it's this you know I know who's in my inbox. It's very similar to me having to come in here in my my dashboard and say, "Okay, this is you know who I'm looking at to call this week." So, it's it's very similar. It's right here. It's much easier for each CHP to not have to go and filter through the dashboard all the time. So, I do like that. I don't like that it's not filterable by CHP because I'm not Nicole's like, I'm not coming in tomorrow.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Well, who
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: am I
Efrain Calderon: You
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: calling?
Efrain Calderon: were you were showing that. So it's like it sounds like on the old dashboard that was much easier to look for and now you've kind of lost that. So that's probably a way it's made it harder.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Like I could filter this by I could filter this by and know like well when Marcy is out for
 
 
00:31:53
 
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: three weeks, you know, I can go in and just be like, okay, week so I can plan and add them into my day and I can, you know, do all of that. So it was just so much easier to know who and I don't know really why that I don't know what the management dashboard looks like. Like there's stuff that Gary can do that I can't. From what he showed me, it looks horrible. Um then he can have it.
Efrain Calderon: in
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: But
Efrain Calderon: terms of just like same thing like getting
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: you
Efrain Calderon: information
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: know
Efrain Calderon: about like who's due for what kind of stuff.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: about whom you
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. pretty. Yes. So it just it looked really but didn't see it in action so I don't know. He just showed me a screenshot of it and
Efrain Calderon: Well,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it looked
Efrain Calderon: we we
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: really
Efrain Calderon: randomized
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: horrible.
Efrain Calderon: a bunch of folks to reach out to from the from the group and we did it by roll too.
 
 
00:32:39
 
Efrain Calderon: So hopefully we'll we'll get some insights too from the you know from from those kind of views and the more interesting views.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: And I'm pretty sure Gary's meeting with you this week, too.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Um, if you had to quantify this, I know this is like a little corny, but like if you had to go from like a scale of one to five in terms of like how much farther do you feel the workflow is now given all the changes even including because I know you you mentioned some of it isn't necessarily the product, but it's just like the process of like calling some times now. Um, one to five with one being like not much harder to like five being like way way way harder. Um, what would you kind of like number it?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, for me personally, it's probably more like a two. It's not that much harder for me to call a couple of people extra because I know that there are people every dime that are just not going to answer. I just, we all have those members.
 
 
00:33:28
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, I think probably if I had more members, it would be
Efrain Calderon: more.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: more
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: obviously. Um, I mean, one of my one of the best is struggling because you know, like we always kind of hope that somebody's not going to answer. I know that's not the right thing to do, but like when you have to make 10, 12 calls a day, you hope that somebody doesn't answer, but when you
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: call them again, they're like, "Oh, you must really need to talk to me." It's like, "I really didn't want to talk to you, but okay." And then they'll call back or they're, you know, they email back and it's like you're
Efrain Calderon: Now
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: inviting
Efrain Calderon: you have less time to hit
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: now
Efrain Calderon: the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: you
Efrain Calderon: rest of the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: less
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: time. So, you know, our CHPs are overburdened already. So,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: having to do all these extra calls is just I think it's just annoying.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: but I mean, I understand the point, you know, the reason behind it. It's just it's a lot. But then I think, you know, having to look at it and never feeling like, you know, the attempts that I'm doing and the work I'm doing today, like it's not I'm not going to know if it mattered until tomorrow when it all goes away. And it's I think
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it's it's overwhelming visually just to look at all of this. So, I don't
Efrain Calderon: That's
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like
Efrain Calderon: an
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that.
Efrain Calderon: interesting point though. Yeah. Like you wouldn't see, let's say, all the good work you did to get to those two attempts on the due date until the next day. And even then, you just sort of see the fact that they're not there anymore.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: Um,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it's
Efrain Calderon: versus
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: just
Efrain Calderon: like them going away in the moment,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I just
Efrain Calderon: you know,
 
 
00:34:47
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: want it to go away. Like I did it. I tried like let me move on to something else. But it's just you still have to like look, okay, well, did I actually call everybody? You know, is everything done?
Efrain Calderon: right?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's just it's really visually overwhelming and I don't like that.
Efrain Calderon: Anything else you'd like to share that we didn't get a chance to talk about in terms of changes to 360 page or regular check-in or to the inbox or regular check-in stuff or anything like that?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, I definitely like I would like to see this panel go away.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's useless if you put the team panel there instead and just had that little tiny like who's the primary. I think that would be much like much more functional and useful.
Efrain Calderon: So,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um,
Efrain Calderon: if if you just relied on, let's say, like the care plan, right, to see like um I guess what I'm saying, what I'm trying to understand is like how do you how do you like let's say you land on the 360 page, right, and there's no more upcoming overdue task panel.
 
 
00:35:39
 
Efrain Calderon: Like, let's say it's gone. Um,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: there's no more what? I'm sorry. It was breaking up
Efrain Calderon: sorry,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: a little bit.
Efrain Calderon: the Yeah, we're both mad. the the upcoming overdue tasks like you said, hey, I would get rid of this and I would just have the teams panel there or the teams widget. Um, let's say this is gone. Um, is there any way that you would know whether something is like an overdue task?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah, you just go right into the care plan. It's
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: right there
Efrain Calderon: And you would just scroll through and look for
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: for sure.
Efrain Calderon: um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah, I definitely will. It's just any like they always encourage us whenever we're making a phone call to go into the care plan to see if one if because the nurses are now giving us three month goals which is absurd because nobody ever completes a goal in three months. So now you know the goals are expiring.
 
 
00:36:24
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So you got to make sure your goals aren't expired anyway. So you have to go in the care plan and while you're in there like there's no reason why I mean it comes up red when it's overdue. So it's very easy to see that it's overdue.
Efrain Calderon: What happens when the goals expire? I'm just curious. This isn't even part I'm just curious because you
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Then
Efrain Calderon: mentioned
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it
Efrain Calderon: it
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: just
Efrain Calderon: seems
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: show
Efrain Calderon: to be happening
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: um
Efrain Calderon: a
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: who
Efrain Calderon: lot.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: did I see? It'll just it'll show like there will be no it'll say over um expired extend
Efrain Calderon: Uhhuh.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: or something like that. And then the members tasks will be past due because the members task usually this one isn't but it's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, it's like related to the goldie,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it lines
Efrain Calderon: right?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: up. Yeah. So like
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I would line this up with the end of the goal.
 
 
00:37:02
 
Efrain Calderon: So then how does um how does that work? Like like um do you just cancel the goal or do you continue it and just change the due date or how do you handle
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, we
Efrain Calderon: that?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: can't um so like let's say Diane this goal was expired. I
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: would have to I can't do anything unless I speak to Diane because I need to know is the goal actually complete. Maybe she did complete it and then I can complete it and
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: be like great, you did a great job. um or you know I didn't get to do that yet or you know it's I'm not done with that so I want to continue it in which case we would then archive it as we can either complete it because they completed it or archive the goal and say the reason why um it's expired and unmet is typically what we're going to use for that and then if it's a clinical goal we have to go CHPS have to go to nursing hours and say hey you know Diane didn't complete her gastro blah blah blah goal and she wants to keep working on it and we keep adding it in. And so then we add it back in.
 
 
00:38:02
 
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Um, well, thank you so much for all your feedback. I I want you to know that like basically my my role right in this whole process as like a product designer the way we think about things is like helping users right and you know that's kind of a weird word but like helping users meaning like help people that are using either the products or the processes that we're like designing or we're helping design because really it's like a whole group. So like you know from my perspective you all are like my primary users people you know like folks that I want to help and you know I used to work customer service at a healthcare company so like I know a little bit about how it could be chasing down folks. I know you all have more specialized kind of like clinical goals and stuff. Um, but like I don't know, it's just very helpful and I appreciate the fact that you're candid because it gives me that fuel to be able to kind of like make it clear to people what's important to you all and why.
 
 
00:38:58
 
Efrain Calderon: Um, because the business might want one thing. Um, that's great, but we know that like you all are humans and also the people that you are calling are humans. So like something
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No.
Efrain Calderon: like the scaminess of stuff, right? like that might not make sense, but um our leaders may not also be on those calls where people are like, "Well, screw it. Then I'm not going to talk to City Block at all because they're
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No.
Efrain Calderon: fed up, right?" Um I think to work with people like that, you have to have this sense of like empathy and understanding how humans work. That may not always be the case when you're like super elite um leadership level. Um so that's where we have to well, I don't know, we try to um explain it step by step in a way that you'd be like, "Yeah, of course that makes sense." But like some people need the step by step of like this is why this is annoying.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's true. I mean, the further the CHPs are the backbone of this company.
 
 
00:39:49
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: They do all of
Efrain Calderon: 100%.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: the work. every single thing is
Efrain Calderon: 100%.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: CH's problem. So, I feel like the further you get away from that role and like even if you've been in that role before, they just forget. They forget what it's like to be in
Efrain Calderon: Wow.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that role and to have all this s*** rolling downhill onto them and like
Efrain Calderon: Plus it's like it's not just that. It's like, okay, your welcome activities, your regular check-in tasks, your you got to schedule these appointments. I'm like, how do how do people actually, you know, and I can see like on your scratch pad you're like, you got these things listed of what you're doing and it's like it's so hard. But
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I
Efrain Calderon: um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: for everybody and that's why I would like to see so Gary and I were were supposed to be like trying to pilot some sort of panel that's for HRA scheduling because we have like this expectation for how often we're calling
 
 
00:40:33
 
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: people for HR scheduling. I track it manually. So, it's like they called on this date and this date and this date and this date and this date and this and I just it's all and everybody's scratch pad looks like crazy when they're in the H scheduling window. It's like there's no reason for it. Make it automatic.
Efrain Calderon: Well, the good thing is
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So,
Efrain Calderon: I'm on the scheduling team as well. So that is something that you know in my head I'm like okay well this I if well that's more the attempt. So it's not that it's been scheduled, but you imagine if something was scheduled, how can we make that easy to like, you know, a lot of times we capture data at Cityblock, but then like it doesn't speak to other things when it when it should, right? Um, but you know, also part of it is like, you know, we're being rep prioritized on things and stuff like that. I'd like to improve things on scheduling, but then it's like you get a mandate on like ways of working.
 
 
00:41:18
 
Efrain Calderon: You're like, okay, cool. I guess we'll help with that. So I mean, it's it's probably similar. It's different, but it's like similar where it's like focus on H. Okay, wait. No, we have to focus on these numbers
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Oh yeah,
Efrain Calderon: and focus
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: this
Efrain Calderon: on
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: is the most important thing.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Everything
Efrain Calderon: everything
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: can't be
Efrain Calderon: is
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: the
Efrain Calderon: the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: most
Efrain Calderon: most
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: important
Efrain Calderon: important
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: thing.
Efrain Calderon: thing. Exactly. So, well, thanks
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: so much for your help. Um, I may reach out with follow-up questions. If you have any questions for me, feel free to just send me a message anytime. And I may not be able to fix it. This is what I always say, like I may not be able to fix it, but I might know someone who could, and we're always trying, but it's like it's a whole group thing here, you know, one one person alone. I can't. It'd be very different if I could but it might not be made. That makes sense for business, either. They probably know things. I know what that stuff. So,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No, I totally get it.
Efrain Calderon: All right, have
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: a good rest of your day. Hopefully, you get those calls people picking up or
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: not, whatever else. All right. Take care.

Summary
Cheryl Newbury reported significant workflow inefficiencies due to the new system, citing increased call volume (over 100 due on March 31st compared to a typical 20-30 due each week), the reintroduction of opted-out members. Key feedback included the inability to remove completed check-ins after 2 attempts and the persistence of "on hold" tasks, hindering efficiency and impacting member communication, particularly regarding call frequency and the system's prioritization of call volume over in-person care.  The team should investigate system improvements, focusing on a consolidated task view, eliminating unnecessary check-ins, and addressing data access delays within the Zeus system.


Details
* Work Process and Challenges: Cheryl Newbury described their daily workflow in the comments section, noting significant changes due to new system implementations. They previously prioritized urgent tasks and check-ins, but the new system requires checking four tabs and has created inefficiencies, particularly with a large influx of calls (over 100) due unexpectedly on March 31st (00:01:13).  The new system also re-introduced individuals previously marked as hard-to-reach and opted out (00:03:12).  They expressed frustration with the redundancy and the increased workload compared to a typical week (00:02:26).
* March 31st Call Volume:  The new system unexpectedly assigned over 100 calls due on March 31st, significantly more than a typical week's volume of 20-30 calls (00:02:26).  Many of these individuals were previously marked as hard-to-reach and had been sent hard-to-reach letters the previous month.  This caused a large increase in workload and resulted in the reintroduction of individuals who had opted out of contact or had many previous unsuccessful contact attempts (00:01:13) (00:03:12).
* System Usability Feedback: Cheryl Newbury expressed a strong preference for a consolidated view of all tasks and check-ins, rather than the current four-tab system.  They found that the separation of regular check-ins from other tasks did not improve efficiency (00:04:23).  They also suggested that completed regular check-ins should be removed from the list, as their persistence created unnecessary scrolling and task management (00:07:02). The current "within seven days" view was deemed acceptable, with a preference for a rolling seven-day view (Wednesday to Wednesday) to account for weekend tasks (00:09:17).
* "On Hold" Status and Regular Check-ins: The "on hold" tag, indicating a member is in the TOC (Transfer of Care) process, caused concern because tasks remain on the list even after the due date, despite being inactive. Cheryl Newbury explained their typical workflow involving canceling regular check-ins and creating new ones after receiving TOC handoff workflows, stating that the current system removes their autonomy and creates unnecessary red flags (00:11:32). The issue was identified as the inability to adjust or remove check-ins even when unnecessary or unwanted by the member (00:13:36).
* Member Communication and System Limitations:  Cheryl Newbury highlighted a conflict between the system's frequency of calls and member preferences. The system's focus on quantity of calls over quality of care and in-person interactions was criticized. They explained how frequent calls, even for minor reasons, could upset members and lead to severed ties (00:14:33).  The example of Sharon Jackson, who prefers monthly calls but receives far more, demonstrates this conflict (00:13:36).
* Quality of Care vs. System Metrics: The current system prioritizes phone call volume over in-person visits and meaningful interactions (00:17:12).  Cheryl Newbury emphasized the importance of in-person visits, where they provide more comprehensive care, like accompanying patients to appointments and advocating for them (00:18:25). This high-quality interaction, which is more valuable for members, is treated as unproductive time by the system (00:17:12).
* Zeus System Issues: Cheryl Newbury reported difficulties with the Zeus system, particularly regarding data access and update times. Accessing information requires a 24-hour delay, causing further inefficiency and impacting timely patient care (00:19:39).  The lack of consistency in the display of quality gaps, such as missing mammograms or vaccines, is also a problem (00:21:19).
* Assessment Tool Feedback: Cheryl Newbury found the "Essentials" assessment tool to be unhelpful and non-conversational, hindering personal connections with patients.  They stressed the value of the "Member 360" tool for comprehensive patient information over the assessments that provide limited data (00:23:18).

Cheryl / Efrain - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Efrain Calderon: Um, and uh, let me see here. If you could, would you mind um, sharing your screen? Um, and I'm just going to ask you some questions about kind of like how you how you work through the day.
Cheryl Newbury: Okay. You want me to go to comments?
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, if that's okay. Yeah. And um
Cheryl Newbury: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: All right. And I wanted you to check out um I guess like I would say like how do you usually start your day in comments? Life very
Cheryl Newbury: Um, so what I usually do is I go to my inbox and um, now I mean it's I I absolutely understand and support the idea behind what you guys have done, but I never had any trouble keeping up. I worked in the ER
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Cheryl Newbury: for 25 years. So,
Efrain Calderon: Wow.
Cheryl Newbury: I have no issue I had no issues keeping up. So, now I've had to totally change the way that I normally work.
 
 
00:01:13
 
Cheryl Newbury: And um it's kind of screwing with my head. So, what I normally do is now I go to my regular check-ins. I check those out first. um and do what I need, you know, look and see what's up there. I check my due today because that's going to show me my urgent check-ins, my mic follow-ups, and that kind of thing. I'll get those two things done first. Then I will look at my due this week to see what's what's cooking there. And um I kind of look at my tasks to see, you know, what else is going on. And right now I am working on this awful March 31st list that we
Efrain Calderon: Can
Cheryl Newbury: all
Efrain Calderon: you
Cheryl Newbury: got.
Efrain Calderon: tell me? Yeah. Can you tell me why it's awful or what?
Cheryl Newbury: Um, well, what it did was it's kicking up all of these people that last month I already sent hardto-reach letters to, and it's just kicked all of those people back into the calling cadence.
 
 
00:02:26
 
Cheryl Newbury: I'm
Efrain Calderon: So
Cheryl Newbury: calling
Efrain Calderon: are
Cheryl Newbury: people that we have not contacted or been able to reach since 2023.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. So it's like grouping all these folks that have been hard to reach now all of a sudden and like they're all due on March 31st. Seems
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah, it kicked out um over a hundred people for me to call on March 31st by call twice by March 31st
Efrain Calderon: Uh just so that I have a sense of like how that compares to like a typical week. Um, so if if this March 31st group is like a hundred people, like like usually how much will it be in a week to do like regular chips?
Cheryl Newbury: in a week. Maybe 20 or 30
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. So that's like
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: more
Cheryl Newbury: I
Efrain Calderon: than
Cheryl Newbury: mean,
Efrain Calderon: double
Cheryl Newbury: that's in a week.
Efrain Calderon: easily.
Cheryl Newbury: This is in a day.
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: okay. Wow.
 
 
00:03:12
 
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Okay. Never mind.
Cheryl Newbury: It's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Cheryl Newbury: huge.
Efrain Calderon: that's a
Cheryl Newbury: And the
Efrain Calderon: lot more
Cheryl Newbury: other thing
Efrain Calderon: then.
Cheryl Newbury: is
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Cheryl Newbury: a lot of them um I just went through I got about a quarter of the way through the list and I had 10 that were opted out of services, do not contact that kicked back in. So,
Efrain Calderon: Well, yeah.
Cheryl Newbury: you know, I mean, it's just it's it's a lot of redundancy. One of the people on this list that kicked back to me, let me find her because I keep a spreadsheet of who I've called. Um, there's one on here that kicked in that's not consented, has never been reached or contacted since 2022, and they kicked back up for a regular uh check-in. I've got one that had five connection attempts in February and four in March and she kicked back in.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. So, these are folks that we've we've tried and tried.
Cheryl Newbury: Right. And I mean I think I gave Dedra probably 40 hardtoreach to send last month and all of those people have come back to call again.
 
 
00:04:23
 
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. Um well that's important to know. I mean I could um there's like different work groups, right? Like that are sort of thinking about different things as they come up. Um so I'll have to like double check and check in on that. I'm guessing that there's someone already sort of like aware of this and hopefully working towards a solution just because that's not really like reasonable to have a hundred people let's say do on the same day for for a single person. That's a
Cheryl Newbury: Right.
Efrain Calderon: lot.
Cheryl Newbury: Um, and then this the having the four tabs to check is just it's just not the way I worked. Um, well, what I did was I set it up, and I can still kind of do it this way. Um, I had, it's just my regular check-ins don't show up, but I had a view set up to do, and it just showed everything that needed to be done and my regular check-ins. It was on one list and I could just scroll through it and go down every day and look at what needed to be done and it was all on one page.
 
 
00:05:31
 
Efrain Calderon: So it uh it sounds like you know now this this work to like separate the regular check-ins from the other tasks. Um hasn't h how has that changed things for
Cheryl Newbury: It
Efrain Calderon: you
Cheryl Newbury: just
Efrain Calderon: then?
Cheryl Newbury: it just hasn't helped me because I'm not a flipper and I'm not one of those people that keeps a bunch of tabs open and and that kind of thing. And I've noticed with um especially one of my CHPs who cannot seem to be caught up for anything that this has not helped him at all. He's still behind on a bunch of stuff. That's okay. I would just like to be able to see everything on one page. Um, instead of having the regular check-in separated out. I like the way it has the two attempts. I like that a lot. Um, I would just like to be able to have everything on one page so I can look at it. So, like I have my to-do list. I can see everything I need to do today and tomorrow on one page because I like to plan ahead and make a list.
 
 
00:07:02
 
Cheryl Newbury: I just like how it shows me, okay, I don't have to because I work ahead and then I know, okay, that person's done now. I, you know, I can, now I can work ahead. Like, if I look at, if I look at my regular check-ins, I'm done with my check-ins for this week.
Efrain Calderon: So,
Cheryl Newbury: So now I know that I can focus on the folks that I'm well engaged with that I tend to call every week. I can focus on the hundred people I have to call by March 31st. I can, you know, I I know that this is done so I can move on with something else.
Efrain Calderon: Um, you know, we we've seen different um feedback even in like the Slack channel and stuff about like what should happen, let's say, if someone had already done the two attempts with people on this list. Um, did you have any opinion on that?
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah, I want it to go away. Yeah, if the two attempts are done, if I'm done with that regular check-in, I want it to go away.
 
 
00:08:10
 
Cheryl Newbury: I don't want it to be festering there anymore. it for me. It just kind of muddles things. Um because you know I so I do this and so these are all done and but I've still got to scroll through to see you know what I've got to do yet.
Efrain Calderon: So, it
Cheryl Newbury: Um
Efrain Calderon: sounds like if if you work ahead a little bit now, you've got to like keep an eye out for which ones are done, which ones aren't, which ones you got to go through next.
Cheryl Newbury: right. And um because before what we would do is we would make our two attempts and then we would just change the date to
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Cheryl Newbury: the next month and it would just bump it off the list.
Efrain Calderon: I love how um you know one of the views there in that that like selector on the top now you're showing due within 30 days.
Cheryl Newbury: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: One of them says do or sorry it says can you yeah can you select the first one says within seven days and overdue.
 
 
00:09:17
 
Cheryl Newbury: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: Um, from what I understand, this is like a rolling thing. Like, is it may not be the case for yours here. You might have just had some successful ones, but like does this show Okay, well, let me just ask. Uh, do you think this shows like everyone just from this week or will it show everyone for like the next seven days starting today, Tuesday the 11th?
Cheryl Newbury: Um the only the um from what I was told they only come off once the due date passes.
Efrain Calderon: Sure. Um,
Cheryl Newbury: So and I don't know about this TOC on hold. I don't know if that's going to sit there until she's out of TOC, but I know like these these for March 12th will not go away until March 13th. So,
Efrain Calderon: when
Cheryl Newbury: they're
Efrain Calderon: you think
Cheryl Newbury: gonna sit there and be on the list until the date passes.
Efrain Calderon: um when you think about planning your work and like the this is sort of like the default view. So like the moment you jump into like regular check-ins inbox, it shows this and right now we're showing it seems like within seven days.
 
 
00:10:32
 
Efrain Calderon: So meaning it could be from this Tuesday to next Tuesday.
Cheryl Newbury: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: Do you have any opinion on whether it should be that way where like on Wednesday you got from Wednesday to next Wednesday versus saying um this is just going to show for this week meaning from Monday March 10th to Friday March the 14th.
Cheryl Newbury: Oh, I that doesn't matter to me.
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Um,
Cheryl Newbury: Well, and because some of the stuff does show up on weekends, so as
Efrain Calderon: great.
Cheryl Newbury: long as it, you know, so I know I think it it would be best to show it like from Wednesday to Wednesday. That way if something does fall on the weekend, you can get it done by Friday.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Cheryl Newbury: So that way it's done early rather than late.
Efrain Calderon: Um, you mentioned the how like one of those says on hold. Um, and you you asked like, "Okay, well, does it stay? Does it does it go away past its date and everything?" Um, so we'll see that tomorrow.
 
 
00:11:32
 
Efrain Calderon: We'll see what happens. Um, but, uh, what what does that tag mean to you and and like Yeah, first I'll say like what do you understand the on hold TLC tag to be?
Cheryl Newbury: um that they're in the TOC process, which is great because a lot of times um if I go in to do a regular check-in and I'm, you know, redoing the research. Sometimes I'm not sure and Taylor and Matt are great because I'll slack them and say, "Hey, is this person in TOC?" And they're happy to tell me. They're very helpful. Um, but you don't want to step on any toes if somebody's in TOC. Um, this one I just happened to attempt to call her the day before she went into TC. Um, and she's one that she rarely answers the phone anyway. So whether or not Matt got a hold of her, I don't know. Um, but what will give me a twitch because it's my thing. Um, if this goes red and shows overdue, that's going to make me twitch because
 
 
00:12:43
 
Efrain Calderon: Grab it.
Cheryl Newbury: what I would normally do is she is on hold. So, what I would do is I would cancel the regular check-in
Efrain Calderon: Grab it.
Cheryl Newbury: because I'll get a task from whoever her TOC nurse is like Matt or whatever. Matt will assign me the TOC handoff workflow and then I would trigger the regular check-in for the same day.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Cheryl Newbury: And then that way I don't have anything red or overdue because that is what is going to make me twitch.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, I mean it sounds like if something's on hold because of a TOC and now it's showing overdue, there's really not much you can do about it. So,
Cheryl Newbury: Right.
Efrain Calderon: it doesn't seem great to look at it on a dashboard
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah. It's
Efrain Calderon: here.
Cheryl Newbury: It's kind of like they they took away our autonomy on regular check-ins.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Cheryl Newbury: And I've
Efrain Calderon: that's
Cheryl Newbury: been doing this for 30 years. I'm a grown-up. I
Efrain Calderon: right.
 
 
00:13:36
 
Cheryl Newbury: you know, know what my job is.
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Cheryl Newbury: You know, it's like this one. This Sharon Jackson. um she does not want to be called more than once a month. And they said, "Well, maybe you should change her acuity." I'm not arguing with the acuity.
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Cheryl Newbury: What I'm saying is multiple people are calling her. She only wants to be called every 30 days. So, I should be able to change that check-in or cancel that checkin so I don't piss her off because she is
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, it sounds like that workaround suggestion of like change the acuey. It sounds like the problem is that sometimes the accut is right,
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: but that
Cheryl Newbury: exactly
Efrain Calderon: has nothing to do with the fact that someone doesn't want to be called.
Cheryl Newbury: right. Yeah, she just doesn't want us to call her all the time, which I totally understand.
Efrain Calderon: Sir.
Cheryl Newbury: And the whoever it was that called her put in her note, member is really poed.
 
 
00:14:33
 
Cheryl Newbury: And I would rather, you know, be able to change that check-in date rather than have the member sever ties with us because we're bugging her.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Can you tell me more about that? Because like that was going to be my next question like just to do you know thought experiment. You've done this. You you know what what can happen. Let's say someone says don't call me more than 30 days and you call them more than 30 days.
Cheryl Newbury: They get really upset. Okay, so Sharon Jackson um you can see my note here. I researched it after I looked at Delibra's note um because you know she went to the ED, she was very irritated um with City Block wanting to know about her ER visit. She said we're invading her personal business. She's getting ped about all the phone calls. So I looked, we called her nine times in February. I mean, seriously, why are we calling the beeers out of this poor lady? And I was looking and the thing is is I understand the um I understand the TOC check-ins if they're inpatient, but I don't think TOC needs to check on somebody every time they go to the ER because a lot of times times.
 
 
00:16:08
 
Cheryl Newbury: Trust me, I was I worked in the ER for 25 years. They go to the ER for stupid stuff. That is something that I could follow up on and count it as a regular check-in. But you got, you know, so if they go to the ER once, TOC is going to call them three times. I'm going to call them twice for a regular check-in. That's five phone calls in a month.
Efrain Calderon: So it's like the difference could be again coming from healthcare knowing a little bit about definitely like this idea of like unnecessary you know I knew of people that would go to an ER because they needed a prescription refill right
Cheryl Newbury: Right.
Efrain Calderon: um that sounds different and something that you could help with versus a TOC which might be like you broke a bone you've got a new disease now you need to follow up care and set up see a specialist like there could be other things TOC team generally is that the sort of thing that the
Cheryl Newbury: Yes. because we have really fragile people that will be in TEOC for months because they just, you know, they're very sick and they keep going back to the hospital.
 
 
00:17:12
 
Cheryl Newbury: But then we've got folks that, God love them, they have kidney stones and that's truly the only people that can treat them are the is the ER. There's nothing that VU can do for a kidney stone. So, you know, if they have kidney stones and they do have to go to the ER several times in a month, that's, you know, how many phone calls? So, if it's something chronic, I can follow up on that and that frees up TOC to take care of the fragile people. Um cuz it's it really feels like and one of my CHPs was talking to me about it that we're moving a lot more towards quantity than quality because your member visits, the time you actually spend sitting on someone's couch with them, going through their medicines, explaining things, that doesn't count towards our productivity. The only thing that counts towards our productivity are those phone calls. And I've already made 30 phone calls today. I've talked to three people.
Efrain Calderon: I think that's really important what you're talking about and I I get this sense but I want to kind of like ask more about it, right?
 
 
00:18:25
 
Efrain Calderon: Like the difference between like you're saying like being there on the couch and reviewing medications with someone one-on-one uh versus like the phone calls.
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah. I mean, if you know, the people that need us and want to engage with us are going to answer the phone. Um, you know, but the people that need me to go to their house and sit down and just listen or explain things, that doesn't count, you know, that's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Cheryl Newbury: that's like not that's counted as nonproductive time. And that should actually count as twice the productive time because I'm actually making a difference to that person. I'm not
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Cheryl Newbury: leaving a voicemail.
Efrain Calderon: So, it sounds like even even to the member themselves, they're going to value that more. You taking the time going over things versus leaving a voicemail. But our system is counting that voicemail as like productive work.
Cheryl Newbury: Right.
Efrain Calderon: unproductive work is the sort of personto person.
Cheryl Newbury: Right. Because I go
Efrain Calderon: Um
Cheryl Newbury: to doctor's appointments with people and
 
 
00:19:39
 
Efrain Calderon: yeah.
Cheryl Newbury: I, you know, and a lot of times I'm just a fly on the wall. Sometimes I can pull up lab. When we had Health Gorilla, I could pull up labs for the doctor if they were done elsewhere. I could pull up old results. Um, you know, I'm just an advocate. You know, I'm just sitting there, but I'm there for the patient if the patient's scared or nervous.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Cheryl Newbury: Unfortunately, Zeus is the only way. And um actually Ashley described it perfectly today. They put a bow on a tornado. Well, um, we were all really excited when they presented Zeus to us, but like when you want to update something, um, you have, first of all, you have to request the update and it can take up to 24 hours. So, I can't just quickly do something. And if you look at this, her most recent lab is from 2013. And with her, what? Well, yeah, I try to, but it takes 24 hours.
 
 
00:21:19
 
Cheryl Newbury: So, if I have to do something quick and like this lady, I just happen to know with Chiron that I uploaded a 2014 A1C into Athena when we did the whole A1C uh chase list, but um they're throwing me a 2013 A1C, but here's a 2025 CBC. So, where where's all the stuff in between? because it's not there. Oh. Um, let me find somebody. I here I just did I just chatted with Renee. Um, she's so sweet. Um, I noticed that some of them have like, okay, for Renee, some of them say annual flu vaccine mammogram. Some of them don't have the mammogram. Um, so for some reason, not all of the um not all of the um quality gaps are there for everybody cuz there really should be I mean she's a 47y old female. She should have a mamogram on here. Um because the new guidelines are once a year for women over 40. I still asked her about it. Um, but I it should be up here.
 
 
00:23:18
 
Cheryl Newbury: Um, oh, and I just saw this on St. Martins's. Um, actually, my nephew is a dentist and he volunteers there, so I'll ask him about that because that's what he does on his days off. So, he volunteers there, so I'll ask him about how she gets in there. Um, so yeah, that's something because not all that stuff is on there. And I mean really, okay, great, annual flu vaccine, that's fantastic. But, um, have they had the numovax if they're eligible? Have they had the shingles vaccine if they're eligible? You know, I think there are a lot more. There could be a lot more to this quality gap. Um, I don't mind the upcoming tasks. I don't mind the appointments. Um, the team is fine. I mean, this stuff is fine. This doesn't bother me. Um, I wish more people filled out the member 360 because this is really the best information you can have on a member, but not everybody fills it out. So, I try to Yeah.
 
 
00:24:40
 
Cheryl Newbury: totally blank. And that's the difference between that and the assessment that we do. The assessment is garbage. It tells me nothing I need to know. Yeah. Yeah. Because the assessment doesn't tell me crap. I need
Efrain Calderon: And
Cheryl Newbury: to know, do you live alone? Um, how do you do on your ADLs? What's your past medical history? What medicines? The 360 view, the member impression is what I need is what everybody needs to know.
Efrain Calderon: the
Cheryl Newbury: I
Efrain Calderon: the
Cheryl Newbury: don't care on a scale of one to 10 how much you trust your doctor.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. Which Can you just let me know which assessment you're referring to in the assessment
Cheryl Newbury: Um
Efrain Calderon: section because there's a lot of
Cheryl Newbury: the
Efrain Calderon: them, but I just want to make sure I'm talking about the right one or
Cheryl Newbury: the
Efrain Calderon: I'm
Cheryl Newbury: essentials
Efrain Calderon: understanding.
Cheryl Newbury: right here
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Cheryl Newbury: is pointless. Yeah, this one. It's silliness. And um also the pathway questions are also just silly because the pathway questions make it so it's not conversational.
Efrain Calderon: I'm here,
Cheryl Newbury: When you're asking someone score something on a scale of 1 to 10, you can't make it conversational. You can't make it sound like you're interested in them personally. It sounds like you're filling out a form.
Efrain Calderon: right? Yeah. If I was asking you about this page and I said on a scale of 1 to 10,
Cheryl Newbury: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: how whatever, suddenly it's like a survey versus like a conversation.
Cheryl Newbury: Right.
Efrain Calderon: Um, I know we're at time. Well, hold on. We just come and real quick. So

Summary
Melissa McNeil reviewed her daily workflow, highlighting discrepancies in acuity check-in dates and suggesting a three-day check-in view for improved efficiency.  She provided feedback on the Member 360 view, finding the care plan helpful but suggesting improvements to the "opportunities" box, and detailed her process for task management and closure, including using the "Zus" button for information refresh.  Melissa will continue to use her current workflow with the current system.


Details
* Melissa's Daily Workflow: Melissa McNeil begins their workday by reviewing their dashboard, prioritizing members needing immediate attention based on due dates (00:01:07).  They also check their 10 attempts, connections, and research notes to ensure data consistency.  They described their process as always checking the dashboard in the morning (00:02:05).
* Acuity Check-in Discrepancies:  A discrepancy exists between the acuity check-in dates and the regular check-in dates. Melissa manually adjusts the dates to reflect their preferred four-week calculation, rather than using the automated system (00:02:51) (00:14:48).  They explained this discrepancy in detail, showing how their calculation is done differently (00:16:02).
* Regular Check-in Process:  Melissa prioritizes regular check-ins based on member urgency. They suggested a three-day option for the check-in view instead of the current seven-day ongoing view, to better align with their workflow and reduce feelings of overwhelm. They prefer a shorter, more manageable view of their tasks (00:03:53).
* Member 360 View Feedback:  Melissa finds the Member 360 view's care plan and recent timeline notes helpful for preparing conversations with members (00:11:48). However, they find other aspects, like the "opportunities" box, less useful and visually overwhelming.  They found that the care plan "wraps it up a little bit better" (00:13:06) (00:25:16).
* Task Management and Closure: When a member declines a task (e.g., an annual provider visit), Melissa documents the reason in a note, attaches it to the task, and then marks the task as complete. They explained in detail how they would note the reasons for task declination (00:19:31).
* "Zus" Button Functionality: Melissa demonstrated the "Zus" button's functionality, which seems to refresh member information.  They noted this functionality as useful for updating information and is easily accessible (00:30:44).
* Workflow Efficiency:  Melissa stated that the current system hasn't made their workflow significantly easier or harder but involves more steps than their previous method (00:24:13). The extra steps are largely due to manually updating dates for acuity check-ins rather than using the automated system (00:22:31).
* Opportunity Box Usage: The opportunity box, while considered "nice," is viewed as primarily informational and less crucial than tasks in Melissa's workflow (00:25:16). They suggested that the opportunity box's location or formatting could be improved for better usability (00:27:48).  Melissa felt tasks were more important than opportunities in driving their work (00:26:43).
* Additional Call Steps: The increased number of required calls for acuity check-ins adds extra steps to Melissa's workflow (00:28:35).  While not overwhelmingly negative, it represents a change from their previously streamlined process.  They expressed this in terms of extra steps for existing tasks, and that it is less effective for someone already familiar with the previous system (00:29:40).
* Prior Workflow: Melissa's previous workflow relied on experience and familiarity to manage tasks and deadlines. They explained how they would know in advance of changes to the current workflow (00:29:40).

Melissa / Efrain - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Efrain Calderon: Um
Melissa McNeil: sure.
Efrain Calderon: but uh what I'd love to do is um have you share your screen
Melissa McNeil: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: and just ask you some some questions basically like pose scenarios to you and just kind of like um have you kind of talk us through how you think about different things and how you you work in different ways.
Melissa McNeil: Sure.
Efrain Calderon: Make sense?
Melissa McNeil: I guess so. The pressure. Um, just kidding. I'm fine. All right. Can you see it?
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, it's all good. Um, so I mean ultimately like you know before we kind of dive into specific stuff um I'm just curious like how you typically start your day in comments.
Melissa McNeil: So, when I go into comments, um, this is my member list obviously, you know, whatever. I usually and I know some people don't but I always have and I know this is one of the things that isn't um meshing is the dashboard um like lining upwise.
 
 
00:01:07
 
Melissa McNeil: So this is my originally it was broken but it was since fixed so now I can just see my stuff. So that that worked out. Um, so you know this stuff you don't really kind of look at. You kind of know that information. This is like a list of the LTSC stuff and my member list, whatnot.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. So
Melissa McNeil: So,
Efrain Calderon: when you when you get here in the morning, like what are you looking for and and what's kind of like most important for
Melissa McNeil: yep. So, this is the most important. So, I usually go to this because this is my priority, right? like these people, I never want to be in the red here, right? So like Jeff, like these people are all due today. And it also helps me look at what's due tomorrow because I usually do that stuff today, too, right? And then what's due in the future so I can kind of count it out in my head. Um, so I kind of I always look at my dashboard in the morning.
 
 
00:02:05
 
Melissa McNeil: I look at and I know this doesn't always line up either, but I look at my tens, my 10 attempts, my connections from the past couple of days, right? This doesn't count today. This just the past couple of days. And then I look at, you know, research notes. I make sure like, you know, the number of ICTs matches what I've done, you know, stuff like that. But I always look at my dashboard in the morning
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. And
Melissa McNeil: and
Efrain Calderon: I
Melissa McNeil: throughout
Efrain Calderon: think Ryan
Melissa McNeil: the
Efrain Calderon: posed
Melissa McNeil: day.
Efrain Calderon: a question,
Melissa McNeil: Go ahead.
Efrain Calderon: but
Melissa McNeil: What?
Efrain Calderon: Ryan posed a question about that um minimum engagement panel like that that chart they were there. Is that the acuity check-ins?
Melissa McNeil: Yes. Yep. And they're
Efrain Calderon: Um
Melissa McNeil: not
Efrain Calderon: and
Melissa McNeil: lining
Efrain Calderon: so
Melissa McNeil: up with
Efrain Calderon: they're not lining up with what?
Melissa McNeil: um the in the rci um dates.
 
 
00:02:51
 
Melissa McNeil: So
Efrain Calderon: Um what Yeah. Or what is it that's not lining
Melissa McNeil: I'll show you. So say this is the due date. So, tomorrow they'll be in the red. They need to be done today. But Jeff, excuse me. Jeff on my regular check, I already did Jeff. I just did Jeff, so whatever. Jeff was due the 13th, but technically the 13th he would have been negative. You know what I'm saying?
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: So today's
Efrain Calderon: Um,
Melissa McNeil: day zero type of thing,
Efrain Calderon: so
Melissa McNeil: but I don't know if that really matters, but that's how I think. Um
Efrain Calderon: um, so I would say like let's take that next step. So you've you've um, you know, you've you've gone in, you've gotten your day started, you're on that dashboard. Now imagine um, you need to complete a regular check-in for a member. Where
Melissa McNeil: Yep.
Efrain Calderon: would you
Melissa McNeil: So obviously due today, I've already done my stuff for today, but I had nine
 
 
00:03:53
 
Efrain Calderon: Share.
Melissa McNeil: regular tasks. I completed those. It depends on priority, right? Whoever's important goes first. Um, regular check-ins. I've been looking at this. This is fine. I've learned how to navigate it. One of the things that I suggested, and it's just the way I work. This is a lot. And this doesn't ever go down. So, this is always it's always going to be seven days, right? So, I I' I'd like it if there was a three-day option.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Can you tell me more about that? I know that um one option too that we've heard from folks, right, is like whether you see like an ongoing seven days like you're saying
Melissa McNeil: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: um or like you see just this week or you see like you're saying like the next three days. I'm just curious in your words like why why that's important.
Melissa McNeil: So, the ongoing seven days, I think any normal person likes to complete it complete a to-do list, right?
 
 
00:04:53
 
Melissa McNeil: So, it's just ongoing. I think it's just forever ongoing. I think having an option to have it be that is fine, but I think that giving people the option to just have it be a snapshot of seven days or three days um you know, Sunday to Saturday like the work week type of thing is um is good for people to have as an option. You know what
Efrain Calderon: Now,
Melissa McNeil: I'm saying? Um
Efrain Calderon: how does it make you feel when you see this
Melissa McNeil: well, I don't like it. I want a three-day option. um or or five days, you know what I mean? Um I think it's because that's how I work. But if you continue to look at all this, it's just too much. You know what I mean?
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Melissa McNeil: It's just
Efrain Calderon: you mentioned overwhelm before like that everything was a bit too much. Um, you kind of hovered over the uh I guess the tracked labels. Is there anything here like is there anything um that you are seeing that you don't need to see that's here or anything that you would like to see that you don't
 
 
00:05:53
 
Melissa McNeil: um what I would like to see but I don't see or have the option to is having less days right here as an option. And also um I like the do today. You know I understand like how the separation is happening. Do this week also same thing. It's ongoing. So you think you're completing a lot of stuff and then like you know whatever. So it might be nice. Do this week isn't necessarily this week.
Efrain Calderon: I
Melissa McNeil: It's part
Efrain Calderon: see.
Melissa McNeil: of next
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: week too now, right? So it's not
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: true to statement. So I, you know,
Efrain Calderon: How about the information in the actual rows? Like you've got um an avatar here, like sort of the initials, you've got the member's name. I guess that's the track. Uh, can you tell me anything about what's on the right side there and how do you use it or think
Melissa McNeil: um, again, these these are just off by a day compared to my dashboard, but that's fine because
 
 
00:06:46
 
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Melissa McNeil: I can I know that's they're not connected well yet, but um I I don't mind it. I like it showing the two attempts. I understand that. So, Meline, I've made two attempts. She's not due till today, so I know that she's not going to go away till tomorrow. I understand people don't like that, but whatever. It is what it is. Um, yeah, I don't mind it. I think it's it's it's pretty organized. I just would like a smaller snapshot or the option to um you know focus in more on the actual work week or work you know what I mean a smaller view um instead of the bigger view but you can always have that option right but um I did have a member oh no he's gone yeah I'm not it's not that bad for me um I think it might I think I mentioned the things that I would want. Um, which is that and kind of like just making this more streamlined to be the week.
 
 
00:07:53
 
Melissa McNeil: Um,
Efrain Calderon: just the week instead of like an ongoing seven days. Is that it?
Melissa McNeil: yes.
Efrain Calderon: Can you click into that to do this week?
Melissa McNeil: Yep. So,
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. Do within seven calendar days. I see that. Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: yeah. So that's always going to be which you know it's fine as if it's an option but if it's going to you know what I mean why not have the other option too you know
Efrain Calderon: Can you go back to the regular check-ins folder
Melissa McNeil: y
Efrain Calderon: and can you tell me like um like Meline, right? What can you tell me about that first person on your list?
Melissa McNeil: so Meline um she
Efrain Calderon: I'm
Melissa McNeil: tends
Efrain Calderon: sorry
Melissa McNeil: to
Efrain Calderon: if you can go back to the inbox. I meant more from like the inbox perspective.
Melissa McNeil: Sure. No, that's fine. Yeah. No. So, I know that Meline's more of an intensive person because she had a recent um ED visit similar to or Jeff or has a recent TOC or MIC or whatever it may be.
 
 
00:09:03
 
Melissa McNeil: Um and Mike. Um, so that information is there. Um, I can call her again today, um, as a third attempt um, prior to her going away tomorrow, right? Um, so that's it depends on the member. Um, and it depends on like the research I've done or whatnot. Um because Meline is somebody that tends to not answer. Um it depends on the member. I kind of want to say um you know calling them and leaving them a voicemail and a text and a um I feel like sometimes too depending on the member if you've called them left a voicemail and also sent them a text message that third attempt may be overkill um depending on the person. Um um history um depending on I I pretty much know my people really well. Um I I speak to them often. The newer people I'd probably make the additional third attempt whether it's email, text, phone, but you know you also don't want to scare people. I've worked in human services, mental health, and all that for a couple of decades now.
 
 
00:10:45
 
Melissa McNeil: So, you know, you do push some people away. Um,
Efrain Calderon: So when you say like history, is that what you mean? like that you that sometimes if you've called more than you you think the person can handle or whatever that it pushes them away or
Melissa McNeil: of course. Yep. Yep. Or it's just too much for them. Or or you know their their daily schedule, right? or they're what they're doing. So, Kylie, I've outreached her twice. She works till 5:15. So, I've sent a text. I've called her. I think I've emailed her previous. Well, not only with her acuity, I had to call her for um a flu shot question. I had to introduce myself. I had to because she was newer to me. So, I've physically tried to attempt to communicate with her five times in the past week, it seems. You know what I mean? So, that's a little
Efrain Calderon: Is it that ultimately Kylie's going to have to find time during her workday to talk to you?
 
 
00:11:48
 
Efrain Calderon: Is that
Melissa McNeil: Yeah. And I've texted her. I gave her that option. Um, there's email,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: you know what I mean? And there's other options. So, um, you know, it's it's generally successful. people generally do connect with us, but there's some that don't, you know. Um, I don't think she will be somebody that doesn't. Eventually, she will, but you know, she's not no longer interested, but
Efrain Calderon: Um I have some questions now about like the member 360 view.
Melissa McNeil: sure. Any you want to go to a regular check-in? Sure. So, I tend, you know, it's good to see their acuity. Of course, I like that there. I like this um appointments right here um just to see like I know Meline's due for an upcoming HR um also because I add this information here, but um she doesn't have it. So, I know I need to schedule that with her or have been attempting to. And that information is right here as well.
 
 
00:13:06
 
Melissa McNeil: I haven't like I take a peek at this, but ultimately before I call my member or someone else's member or whatever it may be, I look at the care plan and the recent timeline notes um to prepare for the conversation so I know what's upcoming, what they need, what they're working on. Um, anything down here that needs to be worked on? Huh? Um, yeah. I think, um, I'm a visual person. This isn't I don't know why, and don't take this the wrong way. It's just not just not I'm not I don't know jing with it. I think it's um I think that the care plan just kind of wraps it up a little bit better, right? It's the actual goal. It's the format that it's in. It's bigger. It's in your face. It's I don't know. Um, this just kind of seems, you know, like overkill. I don't know. Yep. I might that. But um I like it. No, no, that's fine.
 
 
00:14:48
 
Melissa McNeil: I like, you know, in the member impression, obviously, you can access a lot of the information. Um, I know someone mentioned updated med list, but I'm not a nurse, so I don't necessarily need that all the time. And that can be found in other areas. Um, this is working out. I always check it after I've make to make sure it's all set. The one thing I do have to say, oh, I forgot to mention this. So, the reg, so when you complete an acuity check-in, I'm not hitting the um calendar that says the blue but I'm not hitting the blue pill that says to line it up with the regular check-in because it's off by two days. Uh, sure. Sure. Um, I guess so. I'm not hitting this. So, say this was her Oh, wait. Never mind. Let me get out of that. Her acuity check-in is due on April 8th as of right now, right after these two attempts were made. Um, when I was doing it, if I hit regular check-in, she would have been due on the 10th at because it's looking at four weeks.
 
 
00:16:02
 
Melissa McNeil: But how I count four weeks. So say if somebody's a severe person, right? They need to be done in four weeks. I go, so say I talk to her on the first, it would be 1 2 3 4. You know what I mean? And then if you hit this, it's not counting like that.
Efrain Calderon: So, is it fair to say that you just haven't used the this kind of like feature for your task?
Melissa McNeil: I tried to use it, but it's not lining up.
Efrain Calderon: It's like
Melissa McNeil: So
Efrain Calderon: once
Melissa McNeil: I
Efrain Calderon: you noticed that change, you said, "Okay, this isn't
Melissa McNeil: Yep.
Efrain Calderon: lining up the right way."
Melissa McNeil: Yep.
Efrain Calderon: Um, the I also noticed that task that says acuity checkin. Is that a task you created?
Melissa McNeil: Yeah. I do it for myself um because it helps you and others if they need to cover your stuff know that that person like that's that is the main task, right? That encompasses all these other ones, right?
 
 
00:16:52
 
Melissa McNeil: You're calling the person
Efrain Calderon: And how do you know?
Melissa McNeil: Oh yeah. Um well, I try to hit on everything, you know. Um sometimes the person obviously can't and wants to focus on certain things, which is fine. I sometimes send myself reminder tasks to follow up on certain things. Ultimately, in my note, I'll summarize our conversation and put follow-up tasks that I need to do. And then if I talk to the person and they need certain resources, I I in a perfect world do them right after we hang up, right? And send them the way they wanted them sent, whether it's via text or email or or whatever it may be. Um Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: How how about if we return to the 360 view real quick?
Melissa McNeil: Mhm. Oops. Oh, I got out of Meline. Does it matter?
Efrain Calderon: No worries. It could be any number.
Melissa McNeil: Date that it's due, number of attempts, regular check-in due. It's pretty straightforward. I don't know what else somebody would be looking for.
 
 
00:18:23
 
Melissa McNeil: Um,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. One thing we've thought about.
Melissa McNeil: you could write HR when the HRA is due. Um, or like the APV and that, you know what I mean? Like you could
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: put that there. Um,
Efrain Calderon: And and is that I mean I've heard that from a few folks where it's important for them to schedule those um annual provider visits or the I don't know if it's health risk assessment, high risk assessment, but those HASS.
Melissa McNeil: So, we have a task for it, but we also in our own pods have an HRA tracker um form and we follow it that way by month and we know the date. So, and you can also go in here and look. She's
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Melissa McNeil: overdue.
Efrain Calderon: okay.
Melissa McNeil: She's well overdue. She's not a great person to show, but um it's usually right here.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: So So
Efrain Calderon: How about um for another question I have? Let's say let's imagine someone has a task.
 
 
00:19:31
 
Melissa McNeil: Mhm. Okay. Of course. It depends on the task because some are more important than others or some are part of an initiative or something like that. Usually you document your conversation whether it's a research note or a phone call you know note um and you know thoroughly explain why the person doesn't want to work on it. Um and then you can close the task. Um so some you don't want me to show you or you want me to What did you say? Sure. Okay. So I wouldn't do it from here. I go into the person's thing. Sure. So Oh, sorry. So, say um Jeff, who I just spoke to, um he didn't necessarily want to meet with a provider because he's very well connected to his provider. And generally, we encourage a provider visit anyway yearly. So, I'll revisit it again, but I did close it this time because we have talked about it a few times. So, um in the note, I would just explain all that.
 
 
00:21:21
 
Melissa McNeil: Um and then when you have a task, it's not on there anymore, but say you had a Okay, so say if he declined, I don't know, say if he declined, I don't even know what I would pick. Um Sure. So um in this not wrote declined APV at this time reporting he's very well connected to his primary care blah blah blah. So down here this one I also wrote up there about pathway as well and I updated Darcy the resource RN that he declined that pathway at this time because he's more focused on his hernia surgery. Um and we can re-review in the future. So ultimately you need to note that you discussed it, you know, you did your due diligence, you offered right and why he's declining and then you can
Efrain Calderon: So,
Melissa McNeil: close the task by completing it.
Efrain Calderon: gotcha. So, it sounds like, yeah, you you talked to the member, they said, "Hey, I'm not interested in doing this." You explain it in the note, and then you set the task, you attach the task to the um note that you're reporting on, and you set the task to complete.
 
 
00:22:31
 
Melissa McNeil: Yes.
Efrain Calderon: Okay?
Melissa McNeil: I think that for me, for my role, I think, you know, there's a few things that aren't driving or like, you know, lining up or things I might want to see. I think that other roles have different things. So there's just like compilation of stuff. There's a lot of stuff. Oh, okay. So I would give me the Oh, what is this? I would give me the option of this being shorter. I would change the Yeah. Yep. Or five, whatever. Um, due this week should be due this week. Um, not ongoing again as an option, I'm sure. Um, and then the regular check-in date isn't lining up, so I'm not going to use that. So, what I'm doing is taking more time, obviously, but it's making it right.
Efrain Calderon: when you say take more time because you're checking the dashboard, right?
Melissa McNeil: Well, I'm
Efrain Calderon: Or
Melissa McNeil: I'm
Efrain Calderon: is that what
Melissa McNeil: manually
Efrain Calderon: you mean?
 
 
00:24:13
 
Melissa McNeil: updating the dates instead of clicking one button. I'm
Efrain Calderon: I see. Okay.
Melissa McNeil: Right.
Efrain Calderon: Um, and then, you know, not to sound like an assessment question or anything that you deliver every day, but if you could say that these changes improve your workflow on a scale of 1 to five, um, where one, well, first I'd ask, would you say they improve your workflow, they haven't really changed your workflow or how you work, or they've made it harder? Um, which one of those would you say? Would you say it's made it easier, hasn't really changed it much, or has made it harder?
Melissa McNeil: It hasn't made it easier. It hasn't made it harder. Um, there are more things involved. So, the way I was working before for me, the way I work, I, you know, obviously everybody's different. um was more streamlined than what we're doing now, but it's not making it terrible. Like there are positive aspects to it. I like it. I love a to-do list.
 
 
00:25:16
 
Melissa McNeil: I like that option. Um you know what I mean? And it's not making it too much more time consuming. It's just a little bit. So Oh, it's okay. No,
Fabiana Simone: Yeah, I just have one more question and this has been super helpful to just learn from you Melissa and how it's been going. So, appreciate um appreciate the time. I'm curious to dig in a little bit more to understand, you know, let's say you're going to call Meline today and you go to the 360.
Melissa McNeil: Mhm.
Fabiana Simone: Um I'm curious how you're using the opportunity box. What does it tell you? And then what do you do with based on what you see here?
Melissa McNeil: So the pathways um the pathways are fairly newer in the sense of like we can offer usually we have a task so I go off of my tasks not necessarily the opportunities the um the pathways are more clinical to me. Um, so
Fabiana Simone: Mhm.
Melissa McNeil: not necessarily something that's a priority for me, but maybe the uh resource RN um I can offer it, but ultimately from there it would be passed on to her.
 
 
00:26:43
 
Fabiana Simone: Okay.
Melissa McNeil: Um, the breast cancer screening and the annual flu vaccine are tasks um that are missing for Meline um and opportunities to ask. So, I'll ask her, but that's I I generally focus on the um care plan tasks.
Fabiana Simone: Okay. And sorry, just to clarify, um, did you say you usually have a task accompanying these items in your inbox? Um,
Melissa McNeil: Yep.
Fabiana Simone: okay.
Melissa McNeil: Usually, it's
Fabiana Simone: Okay.
Melissa McNeil: attached as like an initiative, the flu vaccine um breast cancer screening um pathway offers. Um I don't know if those have changed since we started the pathway stuff, but
Fabiana Simone: Okay,
Melissa McNeil: um
Fabiana Simone: got it.
Melissa McNeil: yeah.
Fabiana Simone: Okay, so it sounds like the tasks are more guiding your work for these um or
Melissa McNeil: Yeah.
Fabiana Simone: is this box is it seems like it's just a little bit moreformational um for you?
Melissa McNeil: Yes. Yep.
Fabiana Simone: Okay, got it. Yeah, thank you. That's new. The opportunity box is new.
 
 
00:27:48
 
Fabiana Simone: So, I just
Melissa McNeil: Yeah.
Fabiana Simone: really want to understand if it is valuable for folks and how it's being used. So, I
Melissa McNeil: I
Fabiana Simone: appreciate
Melissa McNeil: feel like
Fabiana Simone: that.
Melissa McNeil: it's nice. The opportunity box is nice. I don't know if it needs to be here. I don't know
Fabiana Simone: Where would you put it if you had a magic wand?
Melissa McNeil: if I had a magic wand.
Fabiana Simone: Mhm.
Melissa McNeil: So, I would put these two. No, that one's fine. I would put this one. No, no, this one's just too much.
Fabiana Simone: Okay.
Melissa McNeil: I don't know. I don't know if I'd put it here, though. I don't know if it's the font. I don't know if it's just the format. I don't know what it is. It's just not It's just a lot going on,
Fabiana Simone: Okay.
Melissa McNeil: you know.
Fabiana Simone: Yeah. All right, thank you. That's only Additional info.
 
 
00:28:35
 
Fabiana Simone: I was looking for and it was really
Melissa McNeil: Sorry
Fabiana Simone: helpful here.
Melissa McNeil: if I wasn't
Fabiana Simone: Thank
Melissa McNeil: helpful.
Fabiana Simone: you. Now, that was very helpful.
Ryan Senning: I think just the your one of your last comments um in your summary, Melissa, was um you feel like it's it's it's making like it's it's taking a little more time than it used to.
Melissa McNeil: Mhm.
Ryan Senning: Are you are you um specifically naming the acuity check-ins and like the multiple calls for each check-in or is it more than that?
Melissa McNeil: I think that is what it is because I think a lot of obviously we all know numbers um are a big thing so they want people to make more of an effort that maybe weren't right um to outreach people and I get that um I think it's just the um the step the additional steps um I don't Oh, I forgot what I was going to say. I kind of blanked out. Sorry about that, Ryan. Um, oh my goodness gracious. Um,
 
 
00:29:40
 
Ryan Senning: So yeah, it's not it's extra steps to to make those additional calls.
Melissa McNeil: well, it's extra steps that No, it wasn't the cause necessarily. It's extra steps to doing the the the actual tasks, right? Like um going here and and there when before I was just going here, right? um checking to make sure the two attempts are done and the date line like before I just knew you know what I don't know I guess it's going to be good for a newer person coming in to learn this way um I already had it down before so it's just additional um steps but ultimately it's not negatively affecting my workday you know what I mean um I don't want to be negative in that way um because there are obviously positives to it right Um
Efrain Calderon: When when you said just now that like before you just knew um instead of having to check the thing the thing, can you tell me can you like think back to like um how you would know?
Melissa McNeil: that's that comes in time, right?
 
 
00:30:44
 
Melissa McNeil: Um just learning your job, right? Um, I have a certain work like how I flow my day and like that's just how I rolled and maybe everybody didn't nobody works the same way but um whatever I was doing was working for me. So, and I Oh, I love the zus button. I Yeah. So, I have I have a guy that has never answered the phone for anyone. I don't know why he's still on my case load, but anyway, I called today because he is literally due today for an H. So, one of my last attempts was looking in here obviously for more research, but I um this is just so easy and simple and wonderful. So, I had this number of course. Um, so then I attempted that number and I didn't have an email on file, so I shot him an email. Um, see if it was him. Um, you know, I love this. It's just easily accessible for me. I know that other people will need other information and like that's awesome, right?
 
 
00:32:07
 
Melissa McNeil: Like but this is pretty cool. Where are you? I haven't really had to use Zus a lot. I've only used it a couple of times. So, no. Should I press it?
Efrain Calderon: Um, no. I mean, I don't want I don't want to guide what you should do. I'm just I'm just curious. Um, well, if you want to press it, press it. Let's see. Let's see what happens. I don't
Melissa McNeil: If
Efrain Calderon: think
Melissa McNeil: it
Efrain Calderon: anything
Melissa McNeil: breaks,
Efrain Calderon: bad will
Melissa McNeil: it's
Efrain Calderon: happen.
Melissa McNeil: your fault.
Efrain Calderon: Okay, cool. I'll own that.
Melissa McNeil: Oh. Oh. Oh. Should I put in a reason? No. This I guess it would just update it as of today's date if there's any new information that was missing, right? Like a refresh of his page to see if there was anything new. I would hope it's instant. Um, as of today's date Well, I think that when you re Yeah.
 
 
00:33:36
 
Melissa McNeil: when you refresh a page, right, you
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: want it to be
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Melissa McNeil: up
Efrain Calderon: that
Melissa McNeil: to
Efrain Calderon: makes
Melissa McNeil: time,
Efrain Calderon: sense.
Melissa McNeil: right? So,
Efrain Calderon: Um, well, Melissa, I I do want to be cognizant of your time and everything. This is like such great feedback and I really appreciate you being
Melissa McNeil: I
Efrain Calderon: um
Melissa McNeil: appreciate
Efrain Calderon: candid
Melissa McNeil: your
Efrain Calderon: with us, not holding anything back and telling us how you work. Um, if anything else comes up and you have questions about something in common or whatever, first I would encourage you to post in that support channel too because you know people it gives people the ability to say like yeah, you know, I deal with that too. Maybe someone doesn't want to speak up but they're like I deal with this too.
Melissa McNeil: I did
Efrain Calderon: Um,
Melissa McNeil: um agree with a woman mentally I agreed with her and sent it to my pod pod chat and everybody was like I know.
 
 
00:34:22
 
Melissa McNeil: So, I know they're meeting today at 3:30, so we're adding some things to the list, but it was um Oh my goodness, where is she? She seems to be on it. Uh Cheryl Newberry 10:08.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, I was talking to Cheryl too. So, it was a similar thing where she came to me with that feedback. I said, you know, I think that'd be valuable to post in the channel so that everyone could see it. And sure enough, other people were like, yeah, I also deal with this.
Melissa McNeil: I think it's hard in general doing your job right and for the person for the agency and the um you know toughs insurance and and our prov and our payer source and all that stuff and then having to deal with like the reality right of the population that we serve. So you want to get all these numbers and you want us to do all this work and I understand that aspect of it, management, all that stuff. I get it. But then I understand the other piece of it, right?
 
 
00:35:24
 
Melissa McNeil: Like these people do not some people love our our support and how we support them. Some people it's a little much sometimes. So especially if they're not medically doing well or mental mental health wise not doing well. Oh yeah. Yeah. And from different people and it's like,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: "Oh, I feel bad."
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: But
Efrain Calderon: Well, you know,
Melissa McNeil: it
Efrain Calderon: the only way we we can make it better is by knowing it. And I totally I totally hear that. Appreciate the honesty. And
Melissa McNeil: absolutely
Efrain Calderon: um yeah, feel free to reach out if you have any other questions about common stuff or, you know, whatever. If there's something that you're like, I want to post this in support, but like whatever, you
Melissa McNeil: Sure.
Efrain Calderon: can reach out to me, but I'll probably be like, "Come on, post in support."
Melissa McNeil: I
Efrain Calderon: Um
Melissa McNeil: don't mind posting it.
Efrain Calderon: yeah. Yeah, that's good. Um
Melissa McNeil: I appreciate it.
Efrain Calderon: all right. Have a good rest of your day. Thanks so much for
Melissa McNeil: You
Efrain Calderon: your help.
Melissa McNeil: guys have a good one. Bye.

Summary
Jordan Washington-Freda detailed their daily workflow, which involves prioritizing tasks based on acuity and urgency using the acuity dashboard (in Looker) and Commons Inbox, while navigating member pages and utilizing various tools for efficient task completion. Washington-Freda suggested improvements to the 360 page for better organization and information clarity, emphasizing the importance of balancing helpful features with efficient workflow.


Jordan has been with the company for just over a year.


Details
* Daily Workflow in Comments: Jordan Washington-Freda described their daily workflow, starting with reviewing "due today" tasks in their inbox, then checking their acuity dashboard (in Looker) to confirm member due dates (00:01:08).  They check the dashboard multiple times a day to ensure accuracy (00:02:02), and they may contact their supervisor for discrepancies or unusual situations such as a system glitch showing that an attempt wasn't made when it was (00:02:54).  They prioritize tasks based on acuity and urgency, sometimes scheduling check-ins a day or two ahead of the due date for flexibility (00:09:55) (00:11:23).
* Using the Acuity Dashboard and Inbox:  Washington-Freda uses the acuity dashboard and inbox to track member check-ins (00:01:08).  They use the dashboard to check the “next attempt date” for members and use the inbox to follow-up. The acuity dashboard is not always up to date, so they verify information in multiple locations (00:02:02). The regular check-in feature in the inbox provides an additional check that they're not missing anything (00:15:58). A task being in the inbox doesn't always mean it is immediately due (00:19:10).
* Navigating Member Pages and Tasks:  After identifying due members, Washington-Freda accesses their pages and reviews their care plans, checking for upcoming appointments, and reviewing past communications to refresh their memory (00:05:07). They also check for any pending priority tasks, such as completing screening tools (00:05:45).  Reviewing previous interactions helps them remember previous conversations.  The size of their member panel (109) influences their workflow (00:06:42).  They schedule tasks in advance to prevent being overwhelmed by multiple member needs on any single day (00:09:55) (00:12:16). Washington-Freda sometimes combines tasks, such as an acuity check-in and a Transition of Care (TOC) task, into a single interaction to be more efficient (00:13:02).  They use templates for TOC tasks (00:13:53), which usually involve completing specific tools and answering related questions (00:15:01).
* Regular Check-in Tasks and Scheduling: Washington-Freda clarified their understanding of regular check-in tasks, explaining they handle acuity-based tasks differently from other requests.  They don't automatically schedule every task for the next check-in, prioritizing urgent tasks and handling scheduling flexibility (00:08:11).  They prefer to schedule appointments a couple days before the actual due date to account for unexpected issues or busy days (00:09:55).  The acuity dashboard shows when an attempt is due, not when the call must be completed (00:11:23).
* Member Non-Compliance and Workflow Adjustments:  Washington-Freda frequently encounters situations where members refuse to engage with specific tasks. In these cases, they either archive the task or reschedule it for the next check-in, prioritizing what is feasible during the call (00:22:42).  The process often involves prioritizing tasks based on member needs, sometimes leading to unfinished goal pathways in a single conversation (00:23:37).
* 360 Page and Inbox Improvements: Washington-Freda expressed that while they appreciate the additional layers of verification offered by the new inbox features, some aspects of the 360 page are overwhelming.  They find the task section of the 360 page the most useful, while others provide limited value (00:24:28).  While they find the “member impressions” section helpful, they wish it were more prominent (00:25:35).  They use the appointments section more frequently and find it useful for task identification (00:26:28).  The 360 page provides a helpful snapshot of member data but does not always give the full picture necessary for making decisions. Overdue goals, even with current tasks, require further discussions with members (00:27:14).  The additional features in the inbox offer a valuable layer of protection for ensuring attempts are made and aren't missed (00:28:39).  Overall, Washington-Freda finds Commons well-organized and prefers it to other systems. However, they expressed concern that adding too many features could negatively impact efficiency (00:30:28).  The ideal scenario would balance useful features with avoidance of information overload (00:31:28).

Please provide feedback about using Gemini to take notes in a short survey.




Jordan Washington-Freda's biggest takeaway regarding the changes in Commons is that while they appreciate the additional layers of verification offered by the new inbox features, they are concerned that adding too many features could negatively impact efficiency. The ideal scenario, according to Jordan, would balance useful features with avoidance of information overload.


They set due dates with acuity in mind - manually. They know based on acuity how many weeks to schedule a task ahead to, and will adjust to set the due date slightly ahead of the true due date. This helps them feel like they have some flexibility to complete the work instead of waiting until the date something is due and not having enough time to get it done. They didn’t explicitly mention setting anything with a due date of RCI in our conversation.

Jordan / Efrain - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Efrain Calderon: talking. You know what I mean? Um so yeah, I mean if if you're okay with um sharing your screen, I'd love to just kind of talk through um you know, some some of the work you do in comments and stuff. Um
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yep.
Efrain Calderon: and basically, you know, yeah, I'm just curious like how you typically start your day in comments.
Jordan Washington-Freda: um to start my day um I'll usually go to do today uh right off rip I'll go to due today in my inbox and before we had this I would filter for the day um then I'll
Efrain Calderon: Oh, okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: organize them up a little bit um and I'll start picking and prioritizing from here I don't know if that's answering it just let
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: me know if I need to add more detail or not
Efrain Calderon: No,
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: I don't know. That's good. other than
Jordan Washington-Freda: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: like due today.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, yeah. So, right here, like I said, I'll organize them, um, keep them nice and neat, and I will, so I will say that I'll open this and I'll open my dashboard.
 
 
00:01:08
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um because I want to know who's really due for acuity today and not um because for me I put all of my check-ins uh about a week ahead of time just to give myself flexibility. So this I always know that you know um my due today task um you know they might not line up with my acuity. So I'll double check my acuity and I'll have this up
Efrain Calderon: Can you
Jordan Washington-Freda: um
Efrain Calderon: show
Jordan Washington-Freda: when
Efrain Calderon: me
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'm
Efrain Calderon: that
Jordan Washington-Freda: looking at
Efrain Calderon: that
Jordan Washington-Freda: this.
Efrain Calderon: piece? Sorry, I didn't throw up, Jordan.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: The acuity piece. Is that like a dashboard somewhere else or can you show me?
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. So, I'll go into my primary care team dashboard.
Efrain Calderon: And you said that like this lets you know whether someone is actually due or something like that. Can you tell me more about that?
Jordan Washington-Freda: So, right here, um, these are my members minimum engagement. So, uh, next attempt date.
 
 
00:02:02
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So Denise Tom Thompson and um this member right here, they are due the 11th and the 12th. So if I go back to my inbox, I have Denise Thomas and was it James? I'm sorry. Yeah, James Hill. They're right here. But um I will also kind of, you know, just like I said in the morning, I'll kind of just check this out. Who do we got this week right here in these this tab? and I will compare it over here. Uh, a little bit annoying, but I just, you know, I'll check that dashboard at least three times a day in the morning, afternoon, and before I close out just to make sure I'm not missing anything. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Is that Can you go back to the dashboard real quick? Is that um is that refreshing like like almost real time or
Jordan Washington-Freda: so that's you got to be careful someday. You never know if the dashboard is up to date or not, but I know
Efrain Calderon: the
Jordan Washington-Freda: because
 
 
00:02:54
 
Efrain Calderon: object.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I check it every day. I mean, I have like a good enough idea that it's
Efrain Calderon: So,
Jordan Washington-Freda: like
Efrain Calderon: you might remember a name or something
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: that you're like, "Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: I already
Jordan Washington-Freda: Like for instance, like if I'm looking at this today, I only have three due this week, you know? So, like that's I I'll know um Tuesday. I'm like, I have three people due this week. I'm not going to go crazy about it. I'm not going to, you know, worry if it's updated or not. But I mean if a there's an acuity change um
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: you know that's why I also keep up with it and if something looks a little you know odd to me I'll just throw it to my supervisor um
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: and make sure I document
Efrain Calderon: Uh
Jordan Washington-Freda: um
Efrain Calderon: what what would be like an example of something odd like that?
Jordan Washington-Freda: if I know I contacted someone and they're showing in the red that
 
 
00:03:42
 
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: happens.
Efrain Calderon: I got you. Like it would say like no attempt made, but like you know you made an attempt.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. Or if like I made if I made two attempts to Denise yesterday or you know um you know on Friday and it still says they're due. Um I'll wonder why it's not registered. I'll go back make sure that I put the right template and then if I put the right template I'll honestly it does um glitch. It is pretty glitchy. So
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll I don't get too worried about it.
Efrain Calderon: As long as you let someone know. Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, okay. So, I log in, pull up my due today, organize it, kind of just do a brief look through like I know these are acuity, you know, these might be tasks I just got um, you know, left behind or maybe just a research. Um, but, you know, I look at this. I confirm that Denise is due.
 
 
00:05:07
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: confirm that Denise is due and then I'll go to her page and um is that what you're asking? Like how
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: would
Efrain Calderon: Well, I mean the week Yeah, this is exactly right. So, like um how would you get to the nasis page?
Jordan Washington-Freda: So either from here or the D Oh, I'm sorry. So I can click right here, bring up her page.
Efrain Calderon: And that opens it in like another tab.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yep. And
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Jordan Washington-Freda: then um Yeah, I'm I'm sure you want to ask about the 360 page. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Well, only if that's what we use. I mean, like like I said, like a you know, we don't
Jordan Washington-Freda: how
Efrain Calderon: have to
Jordan Washington-Freda: do I
Efrain Calderon: go
Jordan Washington-Freda: do it? Okay,
Efrain Calderon: about
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll keep I'll
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: keep
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: that in mind. So, I come to Denise. Um, she's moderate right away.
 
 
00:05:45
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: I know she's moderate. I'm familiar with Denise. I don't have to do too much dive in. I'll go
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Jordan Washington-Freda: to her care plan. Make sure these are up to date. Um, make sure nothing's expired, overdue. Um, kind of review them quickly. I know her care plan. And I just want to make sure I'm knowing what I'm going to talk about and the questions I'm going to ask. And then I'll look down here, see what uh, you know, maybe prior uh, priority task. You know, I'm going to have to offer her an APV, make sure I complete my screening tools, and then I will go down. Normally, I'll go down, make sure there's no appointments like upcoming today that I forgot of or rescheduled appointment. Then I kind of make my way back up to time uh timeline. Then I go to Okay, I try to follow up on the PCA. Oh, that's right. She called. I'll go down. Okay, yeah, I completed the TOC.
 
 
00:06:42
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll open that. I'll view that. Get my notes. So, I'll just kind of go down our last few connections. Then
Efrain Calderon: So, it's
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: helping you kind of like remember what you all talked about and
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yep.
Efrain Calderon: you also mentioned like you're familiar with um you know this particular member you're looking through the care plan. Uh how big is like your panel of members?
Jordan Washington-Freda: I think it's like 109 I think because
Efrain Calderon: Do you
Jordan Washington-Freda: of
Efrain Calderon: feel like do you feel that way with a lot of members where you're like oh yeah I remember talking to them or
Jordan Washington-Freda: some of them. But
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: it's dangerous to live that way
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Yeah. I got you. So you
Jordan Washington-Freda: because
Efrain Calderon: still
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll
Efrain Calderon: have to
Jordan Washington-Freda: be
Efrain Calderon: do
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll
Efrain Calderon: that.
Jordan Washington-Freda: call John and it's really not John. You know, I'll
 
 
00:07:18
 
Efrain Calderon: I
Jordan Washington-Freda: think it's
Efrain Calderon: got
Jordan Washington-Freda: John.
Efrain Calderon: you.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll be like, "Oh,
Efrain Calderon: You
Jordan Washington-Freda: yeah.
Efrain Calderon: don't want to mix them
Jordan Washington-Freda: Appointment."
Efrain Calderon: up.
Jordan Washington-Freda: So, I try not to do that. But, yeah, there's a there's a good amount of of my members. I'd say I'd say probably a good amount a good a good amount of my members that I'm pretty familiar with. Like Denise, though, is you know, she's one of my closer members, I I guess.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, but yeah, I I do try to follow those steps because, you know, just because like I know Denise, um, I I need to go through the care plan, make sure I'm not forgetting something. That's why I kind of do that.
Efrain Calderon: Um, you know, one thing that we introduced was a way to like set certain tasks due at like regular check-in. And I'm
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: curious whether you think about tasks that way of like this is work I do during regular check-in or this is work I wouldn't do during regular check-in or like I don't know if you've used that kind of thing so far.
 
 
00:08:11
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, so I do have questions about the regular check-in task. Um, it was a little bit tr confusing. So I don't know if it's like when you just said it right there, it kind of made me think of it a bit different than I was told, I guess. Um, so certain so certain things are acuity based and other things are just like, hey, can you call my LTSS? Is that what you're asking? Like I wouldn't mark that task, call the LTSSE to check in. I would mark that task for like tomorrow. Is that what you mean?
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Uh, I mean, sort of. I mean, to be fair, too, D, like I I'm also like I
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: definitely don't know as much about this as you do. So, like it sounds like what you're saying is like there's some things that um that if they're like important enough, like you don't want to set for like the next check-in. Is that kind of what you're saying or?
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll show you here.
 
 
00:09:01
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: so this is their care plan. This is what I work. This is my task. This is what I'm going to ask her about. This is what Denise is working on. So, these are my tasks that I check in on comm every acuity. This is what I'm going over. Some of these tasks, if I offer an ICT meeting once and they decline it, I don't need to put that out to my next. I put that out to next year. So, that necessarily wouldn't go to automated next. Um, this one, another one, if she declines it. Um, you know, or they don't they ask me to call them back. Oh, I have this document. Can you call me back next week? I'm not going to put that test to to next month. I'm going to put that test to next week. That's what I meant. But like in general, yeah. Um I don't mind I would I mean that that seems pretty convenient, I guess, pushing them out.
 
 
00:09:55
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: But then that's another thing. Like I said, I like to put my people ahead um of their due date, even if
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: it's just a couple days
Efrain Calderon: Is
Jordan Washington-Freda: because,
Efrain Calderon: there Yeah. Can you tell me why?
Jordan Washington-Freda: well, if I miss a day, if I get really busy, I have 109 members. So if I'm putting everyone on acuity, that's not going to work. I need to be ahead of it because if I have five members that you know present at an emergency department and I have to follow up with them and then I have you know another major member concern or a meeting. So I like to be ahead of um acuity always at least at bare minimum a day or two but it does happen a lot you know I have if I don't do that I would have a lot more people do on one day you know today I have two
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Jordan Washington-Freda: people do but if I didn't do that I'd probably have like you know you never know I might have 10 people do today along with all these other tasks that I got to complete you
 
 
00:10:51
 
Efrain Calderon: It sounds like part of it is like uh you know you want to make sure you complete it kind of before it's due.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Well,
Efrain Calderon: Is
Jordan Washington-Freda: you
Efrain Calderon: that
Jordan Washington-Freda: don't want to be behind. You don't
Efrain Calderon: you
Jordan Washington-Freda: want to
Efrain Calderon: don't
Jordan Washington-Freda: be
Efrain Calderon: want you behind?
Jordan Washington-Freda: in
Efrain Calderon: And
Jordan Washington-Freda: and then
Efrain Calderon: so if sorry.
Jordan Washington-Freda: No, no, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Efrain Calderon: So is it like cuz like if I would have said it for like let's say the check-in today then is it is the idea that like well if I don't get them today then like I'm going to be overdue tomorrow basically, right? Like is that
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yes.
Efrain Calderon: kind of the the idea? Like, hey, set it a couple days ahead. Then
Jordan Washington-Freda: So
Efrain Calderon: I have
Jordan Washington-Freda: they
Efrain Calderon: some some
Jordan Washington-Freda: have
Efrain Calderon: room.
Jordan Washington-Freda: to Yeah, that dashboard I showed you, that's when the attempt is due.
 
 
00:11:23
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: like
Efrain Calderon: I got
Jordan Washington-Freda: you need to at least have tried to call them by that day.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: So if I call them three days early, they don't answer, but then they call me back the next day. Um they're within that acuity time frame, even though it doesn't matter, just the attempt needs to be. And then I will say that like yeah, I have to be ahead of like I have 109 members. If I'm not ahead of
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: them, then, you know, I'm going to be just running around all day, you know, um
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: all disorganized. So, yeah, if I have if
Efrain Calderon: So
Jordan Washington-Freda: I can, I'll definitely get ahead. Always schedule ahead because then I have the flexibility, too. If I go in my dashboard and they're due in four days and I'm really busy, you know, I might call them even earlier or um I might if they're due in four days, but they're in my my my due today inbox, I can still move them out to tomorrow if I had to.
 
 
00:12:16
 
Efrain Calderon: All right. You have
Jordan Washington-Freda: You
Efrain Calderon: that
Jordan Washington-Freda: know what
Efrain Calderon: option.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I mean? Like if my inbox is five pages long and I'm working and then it's almost five o'clock, I can still push
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: that out till tomorrow. But if I didn't do that, I'd be screwed.
Efrain Calderon: Right. Right. That makes sense. Um,
Jordan Washington-Freda: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: how would you determine like like if you know that you have to do it, you know, a day or two before then, how would you know what day the check-in is?
Jordan Washington-Freda: So if they're moderate, um if their cut is moderate, it's six weeks, I
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: believe. So then I would do five weeks.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Sorry.
Efrain Calderon: So, you're just doing
Jordan Washington-Freda: On a
Efrain Calderon: the
Jordan Washington-Freda: calendar,
Efrain Calderon: math.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I would just go like this.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: And
Jordan Washington-Freda: go
Efrain Calderon: you know
Jordan Washington-Freda: one,
 
 
00:13:02
 
Efrain Calderon: how
Jordan Washington-Freda: two,
Efrain Calderon: many weeks
Jordan Washington-Freda: three, four, five. You know what
Efrain Calderon: do
Jordan Washington-Freda: I mean?
Efrain Calderon: you
Jordan Washington-Freda: And
Efrain Calderon: All right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: then if this is the sixth week, you know, it doesn't have to be on the 12. It could be in the 10th. It could be, you know, it's within that week. That's how I do it at least.
Efrain Calderon: Right. Um, have you have you ever uh run into a situation where like um you shouldn't reach out to someone for a check-in because they have like a TOC that's active.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'll do both. I'll
Efrain Calderon: You
Jordan Washington-Freda: do a
Efrain Calderon: do both.
Jordan Washington-Freda: temp I'll do a TOC and my acuity template. Same with MIC. Like if someone has an MI a TOC task like they were just discharged yesterday and then they also were due for acuity today. I'll combine the note.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. This way it'll count for the check-in but also you know you got to do your TOC work itself.
 
 
00:13:53
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. Yeah. because all the TOC needs is this. And then um you know I have my own template right here. So I'll put this in. I'll also do this. And then I'll just kind of make them neat. Make them neater. I'll do this.
Efrain Calderon: So you have a template for the uh for like what you would discuss during a TOC. Do you put that on every member's um scratch pad or is it just like
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, this just happened like she just had a recent one. So, I kind of just copied and pasted it in there
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: and it
Efrain Calderon: cuz
Jordan Washington-Freda: was still
Efrain Calderon: you've
Jordan Washington-Freda: in
Efrain Calderon: got your
Jordan Washington-Freda: my
Efrain Calderon: notes there.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: this is my notepad. So,
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I have my own like to template right here. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Is it that when a TOC happens and again like forgive me if I'm you know I'm not I know kind of a transition care generally but is it like after a TOC uh is there like a set a set like work that you have to do with that member and is it is it something that like someone has to tell you to go do this this this or is it always kind of the same thing?
 
 
00:15:01
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So it's uh if someone's um emergency room, you know, well, yeah,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I won't go too far into detail. So if someone has a COC task and I have to call them, I have to call them and I have to complete this tool. So, it's the
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: same tool. Uh, here it is.
Efrain Calderon: And then you're answering question.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. And you're
Jordan Washington-Freda: So,
Efrain Calderon: asking
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'm just
Efrain Calderon: questions
Jordan Washington-Freda: going down
Efrain Calderon: about
Jordan Washington-Freda: and
Efrain Calderon: it.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'm just answering the same questions. And then when I'm done, it's just yeah, you know, I completed the tool, you know, and just put it that in and I'll put all my task and I'll complete the task. So, I'll kind of loop them in if I if I can.
Efrain Calderon: question. Um, can we go back to the inbox
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah, no problem.
Efrain Calderon: and um, like you were saying how you'll you'll check out due today pretty much.
 
 
00:15:58
 
Efrain Calderon: Um,
Jordan Washington-Freda: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: one thing that like Okay. Um, is there anything you like noticed about the new inbox or ways that it might have changed how you work?
Jordan Washington-Freda: I like I said, I don't let I don't really
Efrain Calderon: All
Jordan Washington-Freda: don't let it change unless I have to. And the only thing that it did for to be honest is I think that um it just gave me another place to confirm that I'm on track.
Efrain Calderon: right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Like I
Efrain Calderon: Um
Jordan Washington-Freda: use the regular check-in. So yeah, the due today, that's that's sweet. I just clicked due today. I mean, that's cool. Um, that's helpful, I guess. Um, and then the regular check-in, you know, that's the only other thing I can see that I made two. Um, and then like for this one, you know, I Sorry, I just clicked it. It says that I'm I didn't make the two attempt. Um, and you know, it's not on the dashboard. She's not on the dashboard, right?
 
 
00:17:08
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So she's at
Efrain Calderon: What
Jordan Washington-Freda: least
Efrain Calderon: is that?
Jordan Washington-Freda: So this member right
Efrain Calderon: Like if they're not on the dashboard, what does that mean?
Jordan Washington-Freda: so again this is saying regular check-ins this is saying this member is due by March 10 right
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Jordan Washington-Freda: when I go to the dashboard she that member sorry at the minimum engagement which is the same as an acuity checkin she's not here, right? So, I would kind of be like, "Wait a minute. Where is she?" I'd look for her name in here, which is a pain, honestly. You can you can filter it. Um, so I'll probably do that just to confirm. Um, I I do know what that issue is, though. It didn't register my template, but I'll just show you. So,
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I just filtered it. I'm going to go to that member and
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: it says that she's not due until April 21st. Okay, that's so I have 40 days to make an attempt.
 
 
00:18:14
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: But this says that she was due. So I guess in that way this is kind of like triggering something to make me look into it. So that's that's helpful, right? I don't want to miss anything. So, I don't know if this is wrong or the dashboard is wrong, but I know that there's an issue. So, like that's how I kind
Efrain Calderon: It
Jordan Washington-Freda: of use these things. It's just like another tool for me to kind of check because my work's not going to change unless like, hey, we're going to use this template now or we're going to make two attempts now, but my work doesn't change. And if you guys give me anything else, it's just something for me to double check. I mean, that's how I generally look at it, I guess. Um but yeah, so again I I go in here and um we have to make two attempts in order for it to count. I made one but I didn't for some reason I I went in there and I tried to add it again as you can see but
 
 
00:19:10
 
Efrain Calderon: Okay, I got you.
Jordan Washington-Freda: successful
Efrain Calderon: It's the
Jordan Washington-Freda: care
Efrain Calderon: template
Jordan Washington-Freda: plan.
Efrain Calderon: thing. Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: So that's showing up overdue.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: The
Jordan Washington-Freda: don't know if this is to you or not but
Efrain Calderon: No, it is this is all this is all helpful, man. It's okay. Um the the due today section in the inbox that so that includes like all of your tasks that are like due today basically, right?
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yes. All the tasks that and by due today it's just what the day like it's not all of them are like you know some of these I don't know if this really matters to you but um like I don't know I don't want to pick out the wrong one or anything. So like Jamesville reschedule request like that doesn't necessarily mean like this was created on the 13th. It's not due March 11th.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Jordan Washington-Freda: You know what I mean? So
Efrain Calderon: You're aiming
 
 
00:20:00
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: I got
Efrain Calderon: for
Jordan Washington-Freda: to kind
Efrain Calderon: it,
Jordan Washington-Freda: of go through these if I was really what I like to do is I like to get ahead of my days
Efrain Calderon: right?
Jordan Washington-Freda: and organize my inbox. They don't want us organizing our inbox too much because you know people get carried away and moving tasks. But I mean, at the same time, I realistically, you know, if I look at that, I'm gonna go James Hill, I reschedule in, you know, off the top of my head, I know, but I'll just show you. Um, you know, I go in, he had one task due today. And oh, wait, no, he had more. That's a bad example. Oh, no. Yeah. So, where is it? 11th. Hold on. Let me go back here real quick. One second.
Efrain Calderon: and
Jordan Washington-Freda: All right. So, that's why I didn't do this. So, again, let me organize them. So, I'll use Kevin.
 
 
00:20:54
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: This one right here. Right. He's just a
Efrain Calderon: uh
Jordan Washington-Freda: single loan.
Efrain Calderon: I don't see the the
Jordan Washington-Freda: Oh,
Efrain Calderon: screen
Jordan Washington-Freda: sorry.
Efrain Calderon: anymore.
Jordan Washington-Freda: So my due today um I have like a straggler right here just like a one class and it's an ICT. ICTs are normally offered upon acuitities. So if he was due for acuity, you know what I mean? All his tasks would be there. Like that one ICT standing out for me. It's either he has a ICT scheduled today that I scheduled for him or it's, you know, kind of disorganized. So I will go into his chart and see if I really have to call him today or there's something I'm missing. Um, and I'll go on his chart. And this is kind of a sucky one, too. He has no care plan. But you get what I'm saying. It's just like there's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: a
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: lot of tasks that are just kind of out there and
 
 
00:21:52
 
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: my job to kind of decipher. Does this need to be done today or can I change this to April 14th with those other tasks?
Efrain Calderon: Right. There might be some things that you're setting it a day. You're setting it early, right, to get some work done, but that's different than some other task due today that might be like due
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: today
Jordan Washington-Freda: And I
Efrain Calderon: today.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I don't generate those tasks. Some tasks I
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: generate.
Efrain Calderon: these are automated, right? On a certain thing happening.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. Anyone can can ask
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: me anything. So yeah.
Efrain Calderon: Um, I have some questions. Um, have a couple more questions real quick.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Let's say a member, like let's say there's a task that a member has um and they refuse to work on that task with you. um what would you do next? Like maybe they want to work on some things, right?
 
 
00:22:42
 
Efrain Calderon: But they're like, "Hey, this particular thing, I don't talk about that. I don't do it. Whatever." Like
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. Um
Efrain Calderon: and
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: like first, does that happen? I guess is what I
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: ask.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Oh my
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: goodness. For
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: sure. I mean,
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Jordan Washington-Freda: yeah, because um there's a lot of reasons that happens, I guess. But
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: um yeah, it happens every single time for me. I'm not the type of person who's gonna um you know every single time I speak to this member you know I'm going to ask the same exact questions every time if you know want to um or like uh I guess I should say offer in scheduling something you know if I'm
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: supposed to offer an annual provider visit um if I offer it to them and they say no I don't want to do that I'm all set then I'll complete it or archive it whatever but if they say um right now is not a good time you know, then I'll push it out and I'll bring it up the next time.
 
 
00:23:37
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: But if you know, there's times where I'll be on the phone for 30 minutes and we don't get to three goal pathways, but we talked about a lot of stuff that, you know, um it's about prioritizing. So, like I don't know, are you looking at
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Jordan Washington-Freda: this? Yeah. Like I
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I can talk to her about her medication falls and then, you know, we could get Miss Care Cord.
Efrain Calderon: All right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: You know what I mean? because I already know she's with the LTSC and if she wasn't she would let me know or maybe we just didn't get to it today. So, but yeah, and then there's other tasks where it's just like, you know, um can we talk about this? No, now is not a good time. No, I don't want to talk about this. No, I've talked to you guys five times today.
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Happens all the time.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Yeah, that's tough. Um, just to wrap up, I know we've only got a few minutes left.
 
 
00:24:28
 
Efrain Calderon: Um, if you could change like one thing about, you know, inbox or this process or 360 page basically like all this all together.
Jordan Washington-Freda: H um I don't know. I mean, just trying to be fair. I don't know because there's a lot of digging around, but I mean, what else are we going to do, you know? And then when you get to I I think that if you try too hard and you're like um take like the 360 page
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Jordan Washington-Freda: for instance, you know, um and again this is kind of like I'm not even using this negative or positive, but it's just kind of a thought. It's like this is a lot for me, you know what I mean? Like this is a lot for me who's calling them every day. I I I don't need to look at all this all the time, but other people do, you know, like a nurse needs to come in here and boom, they know where to go and, you know, my CTO can track this, but me, I don't need a lot of this stuff.
 
 
00:25:35
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um,
Efrain Calderon: What
Jordan Washington-Freda: this
Efrain Calderon: would you say?
Jordan Washington-Freda: is important. This memory impressions is important and I forget about it a lot. I think that if this was maybe in the center, it might be a little bit easier. Like something little like that. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. I'm curious like of those things like which which sections are most like valuable to you and which ones like you're just kind of
Jordan Washington-Freda: yeah,
Efrain Calderon: not
Jordan Washington-Freda: the task
Efrain Calderon: a lot.
Jordan Washington-Freda: the
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: task. So, off the 360 page,
Efrain Calderon: Yes.
Jordan Washington-Freda: this doesn't really matter to me at all because this isn't giving me the whole picture. This doesn't matter to me cuz this isn't giving me no picture. This is just says it's open. That
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: doesn't mean that she needs it.
Efrain Calderon: Action.
Jordan Washington-Freda: um you know uh this I I can't I gotta stick to the dashboard and the inbox. I can't worry about what this says.
 
 
00:26:28
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um and
Efrain Calderon: You said the impression sometimes you look at it
Jordan Washington-Freda: the
Efrain Calderon: does
Jordan Washington-Freda: impressions
Efrain Calderon: get long. I
Jordan Washington-Freda: like
Efrain Calderon: know.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I wish I look at it every call. I some I don't a lot but I wish I did most times.
Efrain Calderon: How about the uh like the appointments thing above it? Do you ever look at that or is that important?
Jordan Washington-Freda: right here.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: I will use this more. I don't I I mean, I haven't noticed it, but I will because like I said, I go 360, I go moderate, then I go care plan, any overdue,
Efrain Calderon: This is where
Jordan Washington-Freda: then
Efrain Calderon: you're
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: seeing
Jordan Washington-Freda: go.
Efrain Calderon: your tasks basically,
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. And then I go, okay. Boom. Because if it shows a task up there, I don't really I'll know. have to do some more digging. But
Efrain Calderon: right?
Jordan Washington-Freda: this could task could be current, but the goal could be overdue.
 
 
00:27:14
 
Efrain Calderon: How does that change things if like the task
Jordan Washington-Freda: So
Efrain Calderon: is current,
Jordan Washington-Freda: like,
Efrain Calderon: the goal?
Jordan Washington-Freda: so say this goal was say this goal was for 33 325, right? Say it's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: overdue, but my task is for the 11th, but this is overdue. I don't know if you know what I mean. like if this task is over is the goal is overdue but my task is current and I don't know is this task on that 360 page you know what if this task is a overdue goal I mean that's
Efrain Calderon: Does that change what you do next? Like I'm just cur because
Jordan Washington-Freda: yeah
Efrain Calderon: I just don't know
Jordan Washington-Freda: if
Efrain Calderon: the
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: process.
Jordan Washington-Freda: had if it was overdue I would have to have a discussion with the member on whether you know it's completed whether it's not you know we'd have to have a
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Jordan Washington-Freda: discussion
Efrain Calderon: okay. Basically, yeah. Yeah.
 
 
00:28:02
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: So, like again, that doesn't mean that that's bad. Like, it's just I wouldn't go off of just this. This is kind of just a snapshot. I guess you're
Efrain Calderon: It's
Jordan Washington-Freda: using
Efrain Calderon: not
Jordan Washington-Freda: it
Efrain Calderon: giving
Jordan Washington-Freda: like
Efrain Calderon: you that full
Jordan Washington-Freda: this is what
Efrain Calderon: the
Jordan Washington-Freda: I got to
Efrain Calderon: full
Jordan Washington-Freda: work
Efrain Calderon: picture.
Jordan Washington-Freda: on. Yeah. But it's just like
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: these are all over the place. So, VNA, LTSC, sexual, like, no, let's keep it together. Medication.
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: VNA. VNA. Hey, have you been taking your medication? You still have your VNA? Okay. You know, and then you're
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: like, oh, okay. How about false? You still going to PT? But if I'm like here, that that's not really helping me in a conversation. It's like, do you have a VNA?
 
 
00:28:39
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Do you go PT? Do you do this? So, I wouldn't use it like that.
Efrain Calderon: I got
Jordan Washington-Freda: You
Efrain Calderon: you.
Jordan Washington-Freda: know what I mean?
Efrain Calderon: Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You've got to
Jordan Washington-Freda: But
Efrain Calderon: I mean the conversation is basically how you
Jordan Washington-Freda: but the most important is the moderate, the appointments, the goals are, but I go I rather go to the care plan. And then the member impression is very useful if I, you know, need it. the P the the changes to the inbox you said like that
Efrain Calderon: I guess inbox or 360 al together if you could think of it or if you think one is making it harder, one is making it easier, we could split it off too, however you
Jordan Washington-Freda: uh it's it's so I think that um it might be a a bit too soon. I think that um I I think like I said, anything that's going to offer me more protection, I like it. So that extra layer of like let me go here and make sure I had two calls, I like it.
 
 
00:29:42
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: And then I will
Efrain Calderon: like
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: the
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: protection meaning like it's just it's another spot that's let you know how many how
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'm
Efrain Calderon: many
Jordan Washington-Freda: not
Efrain Calderon: attempts
Jordan Washington-Freda: get
Efrain Calderon: were
Jordan Washington-Freda: behind.
Efrain Calderon: made on a thing
Jordan Washington-Freda: I'm not
Efrain Calderon: that's
Jordan Washington-Freda: going to get behind because now I have like the dashboard, my check, my due today, and I also have my regular check-in. I can combine those. to make sure I'm not behind. And not only that, I can make sure now that we have to make two calls, I can see that I actually made two attempts. You know, the dashboard doesn't show that I made it just removes it or it's red. You know, either I did it or I didn't. Um
Efrain Calderon: Hey,
Jordan Washington-Freda: the regular check-ins, that's cool. Like, you know, I do like that. Uh, I guess now that I'm thinking about it more, it's like, you know, I can make sure that I did two attempts and if I have one attempt and I can go in there and do it.
 
 
00:30:28
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: Um, and and then I I will say to be honest, like I have worked at a lot of places and I I do like Commons by far the most. Like just Commons in general, I do like it the most out of every other one I've used. it it is um pretty well organized and and just useful in general to me. Like I don't even think anything really needs to change. I think it it was good how it was. And I mean, yeah, I think these improvements make sense. I just wouldn't want to see things get carried away because CHPs, you know, we have to like fish through for all this stuff. A nurse only needs certain things. We have to have everything. And it's just like a lot of these just get like, you know, you're going from this page to that page to this page and then you have 109 people. So
Efrain Calderon: Can you can you tell me more of that? Cuz you said like carried away and I'd love I know it sounds silly but like can you like like can you um talk me through like what it would be like?
 
 
00:31:28
 
Efrain Calderon: Like let's say let's say they got carried away. What would that look like to you?
Jordan Washington-Freda: to like like when I f like like I said, you know, my the first opinion from I think everybody probably like in my role it's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: just looking is just too much. there's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: just too much stuff like
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: um that's just unnecessary for me right now. I mean, yeah, it's important stuff, but it's just like, you know, that could be a thing. It's just like, whoa. Like, when I first looked at this, it took me a while to even know what I was looking at when I first
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Jordan Washington-Freda: started. I don't know what what all this is.
Efrain Calderon: How long How long have you been at um sleep for? About
Jordan Washington-Freda: Over a year. Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: Nice. It goes
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: by quick, right?
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah. for sure. It has.
 
 
00:32:14
 
Jordan Washington-Freda: It has definitely flown by.
Efrain Calderon: When I hit my year, I was like, "Oh, wow. I didn't think about it, you know, but
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah, it flew by honestly. But,
Efrain Calderon: I
Jordan Washington-Freda: you know,
Efrain Calderon: uh
Jordan Washington-Freda: busy work, so
Efrain Calderon: well, you know, definitely with that in mind, I don't want to keep take too much of your time because you've already been super generous with it. Um, but I'm just, you know, before before I let you go, I wanted, you know, one, I wanted to know if there was anything that we we should talk about that we haven't talked about yet that's important to this that you want to bring up.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah, I don't think so. I guess I just want to reiterate that like I said, I don't think I'm the best person to kind of like get get anything from. Maybe I am. I you know, um I guess overall if you take a bunch of people like I guess that's the idea. Um but
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, exactly. Yeah,
Jordan Washington-Freda: I
Efrain Calderon: because
Jordan Washington-Freda: don't
Efrain Calderon: I mean
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: there's lots of people that will step up and say like this is the way we should do it. Um
Jordan Washington-Freda: I think a lot of people just kind of get on it too. people like Oh my God it like I'm not that person either you
Efrain Calderon: yeah.
Jordan Washington-Freda: know.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. So like for us there's lots of different ways that people see the world, right? here.
Jordan Washington-Freda: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: oh, so like

Summary
Sarah Kaluhiokalani reviewed Commons' daily workflow, 360-page feedback, and task management, highlighting frustrations with the interface design, specifically unsuccessful call attempts, the 360 page's appointment display, and the "upcoming and overdue tasks" panel.  Key issues included a cluttered inbox, lack of CHP filtering, and inaccurate on-hold statuses.  Her top priority is removing unsuccessful call attempts after two tries to improve workflow efficiency.


Details
* Daily Workflow and User Experience: Sarah Kaluhiokalani described their daily workflow in Commons, highlighting frustrations with the regular check-in panel's design and the display of unsuccessful call attempts (00:00:54) (00:03:21). They expressed a strong preference for a cleaner interface, suggesting that unsuccessful attempts should disappear after two tries (00:00:54) (00:02:29), and that filtering by CHP would improve team task management (00:03:21).  They also noted that they don't use the to-do list feature, preferring the inbox as their task manager (00:04:53).  The current system was described as "cluttered" and "overwhelming,"  leading to a feeling that they are "becoming more scammy" in their outreach efforts (00:00:54) (00:02:29).
* 360 Page Feedback:  Kaluhiokalani provided feedback on the 360 page, specifically the appointments section. They found the current display of appointments unhelpful, preferring more specific information, such as the dates of last and next scheduled APV and HRA appointments, which they personally track (00:07:43).  They noted that the "next check-in date" feature is helpful (00:05:50).  The "open quality gaps" section was described as less useful due to their non-clinical role (00:06:48).  The on-hold status in the regular check-in and due sections caused distrust in the system's accuracy and reliability, as the system doesn't always correctly reflect the on-hold status (00:09:56) (00:14:34).
* Task Management and Archiving: Kaluhiokalani explained their task management process, emphasizing their preference for tasks within the context of care plan goals (00:21:48).  They described how they handle incomplete tasks, often editing or archiving them depending on the member's engagement and the task's relevance (00:24:25). Archiving a task signifies that it cannot be completed for a specified reason (00:25:52). They create personalized tasks tailored to their workflow and their interaction with members (00:27:28).  They expressed dislike for the "upcoming and overdue tasks" panel, finding it redundant and lacking context within the care plan (00:21:48).
* Suggested Improvements and Overall Assessment: Kaluhiokalani's top priority for improvement was removing unsuccessful call attempts from the inbox after two attempts (00:28:15).  This was emphasized due to its negative impact on workflow, especially for CHPs with larger caseloads. They rated the overall impact of the recent changes as a "two" on a scale of one to five, with one being minimal impact and five being significantly harder (00:32:39). While they acknowledged some improvements, such as easier access to who's assigned to what in the inbox compared to the dashboard, the inability to filter the inbox by CHP remained a significant issue. The loss of the dashboard's filtering capabilities made finding information more difficult, especially when team members are out of office (00:31:08).  The 7-day rolling view of regular check-ins was also described as unhelpful, as it gives a continuous sense of incompletion and doesn't provide the closure of finishing tasks within a work week (00:17:58).

Sarah / Efrain - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Efrain Calderon: I guess it's just working now. Okay, cool. Um, and then I may have questions like sometimes when I'm kind of reviewing some of the answers and stuff, I'll be like, "Oh, um, you know, I should have asked this or like I wonder what about this, so I might reach out with some additional questions later
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: on."
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No.
Efrain Calderon: All right. So, um, I guess like before we dive in, I'd love to just hear about like how you like usually start your day in commons.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, so do you want me to just share my screen? I feel like that's easier.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: sure. Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: See, it's a little uh
Efrain Calderon: Totally.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: easier to do than to describe it. Uh, so I've start now I start in my regular check-in panel to see kind of what I have due for the day, which I have like mixed feelings about it. Um, I guess I missed the dashboard.
 
 
00:00:54
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I mean, the dashboard is still here, but mine got really messed up because they added me as a primary for everybody, so that was not really helpful. Um, so this is fine. I mean, for me, it's not so bad. As a senior CHP, I only have um 50 members, 50 to 60 members, so this isn't terrible. I won't generally have as many due during the course of the day. Um, but then I'll also check in on my team, and I mean, this is just like overwhelming to look at, honestly. Um, I hate it. So, and it's not incredibly helpful for me or for anyone, I don't think, because one, I would I would really love to see like when these two attempts are made that this goes away. I mean, I understand that the idea is, "Oh, maybe you'll try again." I promise you, I'm not going to try again.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: We are calling people so much right now, it's obnoxious.
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: If I call a member twice and they don't answer, I'm I'm never I'm not calling them again.
 
 
00:01:49
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I wouldn't call them again, you know, after the first try because it's like if they don't want to talk to me, they're not going to pick up. But now I'm going to hound them and I know if somebody does that to me personally, I'm not going back. So,
Efrain Calderon: So it's
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: um,
Efrain Calderon: so it sounds like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: yeah,
Efrain Calderon: it's less about um not even Yeah. I mean the way you're Yeah. Yeah. Is it just a um is it a matter of calling someone and you've made an attempt and they're not they're kind of like not interested or they're not kind of like ready for the regular check-in and you're calling or um like the scenario you're messing like where you're kind of bothering people, right? Which which is definitely a concern. Is it that they're picking up and they're like, "H, I don't want to do this right now." Or is it like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: These
Efrain Calderon: you just
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: are
Efrain Calderon: can't reach?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah, these are unsuccessful attempts.
 
 
00:02:29
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Like for even for my member who I called this morning and I have to call her again, which I
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: just feel like it's rude. Like I didn't if they didn't pick up before, it's either because they couldn't or they didn't want to talk to me right now. Like I have a really good relationship with this member and I know that when she needs something, she's going to call me because that's how it's been. But now I I didn't get her. said, "I'm going to call her again." And it just feels like we're becoming more scammy and more like, "Ah, you're you have to talk to me today. It's very, you know, like you're just a number to me that I need to make." And
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I because I don't want to be treated that way.
Efrain Calderon: gotcha. That makes sense. Um, you mentioned the my care team to you there.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, it's not pretty much no like if these two attempts are done, I would like to see them like leave the like they should be gone.
 
 
00:03:21
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: They should be out of the the inbox because nobody's
Efrain Calderon: option.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: going to nobody's calling that person again. I'm telling you, they're not. Um, this is a little bit not I mean, obviously I'm not stupid and I can see like this is a task and this is attempt, but like it's just so cluttered and so much to look at. Um, but then I would really like to see this have a filter on it so that you can filter by CHP because
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like let's say you're in my role and hey like Nicole just calls out today and I have to go see who she has due can you tell me which one of these is Nicole's because I can't you know like so it's annoying to not be able to like when I had the dashboard I could go okay you know Nicole has these three members due today so I can call those three members for her but instead I got to do all these jump around and hoops and like who does she have assigned to herself and like what tasks blah blah blah So it's
 
 
00:04:08
 
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: just a little bit annoying that way. So I I
Efrain Calderon: Is it
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: really like that.
Efrain Calderon: is that it that you'd have to be looking for like the task assigning me and like kind of
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: I guess
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Like
Efrain Calderon: you could do it that way or
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I would have I would literally have to come in and then I filter my inbox for pod five and then I have to go who is it assigned to and you know so if it was just in here like hey these three people
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: are due for acuity today and they're Nicole's members then I know I have to
Efrain Calderon: sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: call those three people. So
Efrain Calderon: Um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that helpful.
Efrain Calderon: yeah, that makes a lot of sense. That's good to know. You know, the other thing um well, that you're already giving me such great uh feedback, which is awesome. Um I'd like to So, you you said you start your day kind of like on your I guess on the primary view, is that right?
 
 
00:04:53
 
Efrain Calderon: Like you'll be in that regular check-in or how do you usually like what's the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: first
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So,
Efrain Calderon: um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'll come in and
Efrain Calderon: folder?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'll I'll look at my regular check. I don't use the to-do list. I don't know what the point of that is. I think my inbox is my to-do list.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, I don't know what it's for. I don't know what people do with it. I literally do not use it. So, I there's nothing on it. So, I go to my regular check-in to see, you know, now how many attempts do I need to make for these people? And then I spend a lot of time mostly in the due today for my tasks because that's that's to me that's
Efrain Calderon: Peace.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: my to-do list. That's what I have to do today. So, I like to filter mine to include the uh really understand the point in separating them. Um, it's not helpful and they're more likely to get missed, I think, if I'm not checking to see what else I need to um work from here.
 
 
00:05:50
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, then I usually have multiple tabs open and I'll be like, "Okay, so I got to call Gan." And then I'll I'll open up a separate common chart. Um, and I'll go to call her. Um, I don't won't spend a lot of time on the 360 page because it's
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: not useful to me. Um, really I mean I now I do enjoy that they have like the next check-in date here. That's that's helpful.
Efrain Calderon: Can you show me that?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um,
Efrain Calderon: I had some questions about
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: but
Efrain Calderon: the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: then
Efrain Calderon: 360
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'll
Efrain Calderon: page as well.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. So, this is their 36 little box. Let me just I'm sorry. One my ever since I updated my computer today, it's been running like absolute garbage. I don't know what happened.
Efrain Calderon: Oh, I'm
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's
Efrain Calderon: sorry.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: running like trash.
Efrain Calderon: Most of it's getting through, but um you know what?
 
 
00:06:48
 
Efrain Calderon: Let me Is it okay if I drop video? Maybe that helps. I don't know if that helps
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: bandwidth.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: sometimes
Efrain Calderon: All right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it does.
Efrain Calderon: Sorry.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No,
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that's okay. Um, so yeah, so we've got the next check-in date due, which is which is nice. That was never something we like really had easy access to. Massachusetts, but the acuity is important. The open quality gaps something that I I'm not a clinical person. So in Massachusetts, we're I think different than everywhere else because we
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: don't we don't do the DIAD. like it's just me in this chart unless the members in like the TOC workflow and the nurses in here but it's really just me. So I think we're trying to work like focus on this a
Efrain Calderon: He
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: little bit because I guess it is our responsibility because it's just us. Um but I don't really I don't spend a ton of time in here.
 
 
00:07:43
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um but I you know I understand why it's important. Um
Efrain Calderon: How
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: go
Efrain Calderon: about
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: ahead.
Efrain Calderon: the um there's a section there that says appointments. Can you tell me whether that's been useful, not useful, neutral?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, I would find it more useful if it was much more specific to what appointments. Like if this member has an appointment with the I don't really need that information here. I don't think that's helpful.
Efrain Calderon: I'm sorry, you cut out a little bit. I want to make sure I
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um
Efrain Calderon: get it. You said
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: or
Efrain Calderon: if the member had an appointment with
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: um like the he had like a mic. I think he probably has one.
Efrain Calderon: Sorry, it's cut out again. What What kind of appointment? It's just really important for me.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'm sorry. Is that better? Maybe with
Efrain Calderon: I don't know possibly, but um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Okay. Um so like this member had like if this member has an upcoming phone call, I I don't need to know that.
 
 
00:08:45
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's something that I can very easily check in the appointment with Andrew on, you know, what day. For me, it would be more helpful if it showed the last APV and then I I guess when the next one is due and then the last or HA appointment and when the next one is due
Efrain Calderon: Is that be
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like
Efrain Calderon: Is that because you helped schedule those or
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yes.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So the ones that I schedule are the ones that I I mean I manually track them for every one of my members if it could be something that was auto was when the next one's due. I think um right now like for our HAS are the ones that like the m the I think that we schedule and we have to like really go into the chart to find out when the last one was when the next one is due having it here would be much more of like
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: so this I mean it's possibly you know useful but not incredibly useful the way that it is
 
 
00:09:56
 
Efrain Calderon: Um, have you ever noticed um where the rci kind of on the top left is that it would say on hold?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Was it Dian? Oh no, maybe it was Mary. Oh, so Debbiey's Oh god, it's so slow. This was on hold. Hold on. Okay, that's weird. Mary, it was this morning. I want to say that it was this morning. Um, yeah. Okay, so this one is So, Mary's is on hold because she's in the TOC workflow right now, which is I guess that's the brand new thing that they just started. Um, which is okay. Um, I have like questions about it, I guess.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. What What kind of questions come up about that?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So my question
Efrain Calderon: I don't
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I
Efrain Calderon: know
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: guess
Efrain Calderon: questions.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: dumb question. So So I had a member who was Diane. So she was on hold for now I have an appointment scheduled with her this Thursday.
 
 
00:11:28
 
Efrain Calderon: Thank you.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Well, my question is like if we then I set her acuity for moderate, but now once she's done with showing on hold anymore and I'm not really sure why, but once she's done with her TOC workflow, like I really shouldn't have to call her for another six weeks because I'm literally doing a visit with her. But then is it going to set her acuity due date to 5 days after then? That just seems silly.
Efrain Calderon: Is there a different cadence that you probably set that at or have that be set at after um like the TOC event ends?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So I I mean right now what we used to do was once a member went inatient their acuity would be set to critical. So we had
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: to do a a care plan review every two weeks which is just obnoxious. There's no reason to do that. So they put it on hold now and I don't really see the point now in even making
Efrain Calderon: SP
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: them critical because once you're in the TOC workflow you're going to get weekly to call.
 
 
00:12:29
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So it's not like you need another reminder to call the member for acuity. You're going to be calling them anyway. So once she's done with whatever happened, she should really revert back to her acuity from before. Unless something wildly is, you know, is different and it's like, well, she really does need me to call her every two weeks or every month, then of course we could set it that way, but there's really no reason for me to now because of the fact that we have anyway. So it's just kind of
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: redundant. I mean I am glad that they happened is like let's say I called
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Diane today and then tomorrow she goes inatient. The nurse is now changing her to critical which makes me immediately because it's going basity checkin. So let's say I called her, you know, five weeks ago and she's not due until next week, but as soon as she gets made to critical, I'm So it really helps with that because that was just filling CHP metrics for no reason.
 
 
00:13:37
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's it. See how it goes after. it hasn't been running long enough, I guess for me to see I,
Efrain Calderon: Sarah, I'm still I'm still getting a lot of cut out. I'm wondering if maybe do you
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Do.
Efrain Calderon: think you could try exiting the meeting and then maybe like just re-entering sometimes? I found that can help help with me.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: Um, sorry. I just want to make sure I I
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Oh
Efrain Calderon: get
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: no.
Efrain Calderon: your your
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Oh
Efrain Calderon: feedback, you
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: yeah.
Efrain Calderon: know. All right, let's let's give it a shot. See if
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: it helps. All right, I'll see you in a little.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: We'll
Efrain Calderon: All right, let's let's try this.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: try it video off though. Okay, let's try it again.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, so far so good. We'll see.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I don't know what morning is running like trash today.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
 
 
00:14:34
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I don't know why.
Efrain Calderon: Um,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, I don't know
Efrain Calderon: now
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: where we
Efrain Calderon: when
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: were.
Efrain Calderon: when things are on hold in the in the uh regular check and due, we still show the like due date and the attempt count and stuff. Do you feel any way about that? That's what I'd ask very generally.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I mean, it feels gonna find out like was really on hold. I mean, I don't think anybody trusts that the system's going to work because we get screwed by it. All the his attempts weren't made or if they don't make another attempt for this one, even though he's on hold. I'm assume like we're I guess hoping that after March 10th passes that they're not going to be past due, but I just don't I don't trust it.
Efrain Calderon: You don't trust the So like if if you didn't see the due date and it just said on hold, you wouldn't trust it. Is that what you're saying?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. So, like this is saying that they're due like de her acuity now.
 
 
00:15:37
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It says it's on hold workflow, but come tomorrow, am I going to walk into Deborah showing that she's passed due? We don't know.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: We don't know yet. We don't know yet because this has just happened this week. So, I don't know. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, from what I understand, I think it does kick it forward a few days, but I I want to say like five, but I think you mentioned that too that that might not necessarily be helpful either. That check-in date to to be that soon after like a TOC event, I think is
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: well,
Efrain Calderon: kind of
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: so
Efrain Calderon: what you
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like,
Efrain Calderon: were
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: so what I meant for that was like, so this one is not showing on hold anymore. I don't know why. I she is still in the TOC workflow. So I don't know why it's showing that she's on she's not on hold anymore. So she so now on this Thursday we have a visit scheduled with her spent Lana the nurse practitioner.
 
 
00:16:28
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: We're going to see her in person. Um at that point you know she should be good for the next 6 weeks. But now if her TOC event ends like when this is done say well in 5 days you have to call her again even though she's really moderate and she doesn't need another phone call. So I guess we'll see cuz you know it's too new to have happened. So I don't know yet.
Efrain Calderon: Um, can we go back to the inbox and just have some more questions there? So,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: you know, one question I had, um, I know you mentioned sort of like how you generally, um, filter the check-in tasks back in, right, in those folders that, um, like filter them out by default. Is that right? Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: That would be help. I don't love this like two attempts looks very similar to one task, you know. So, I don't really like connecting in tasks because I just feel like to look at
 
 
00:17:58
 
Efrain Calderon: Sorry, you kind of cut out a little bit again. So, you you don't like looking at I know you I kind of got that you said they look very similar, but then um Yeah. What was after that?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. So, I just don't I don't really see the like why they need to be there. Like why does it even tasks assigned to that member? I we can assume if we're calling the member for acuity, they have tasks
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that are due. So, I just don't think I think it's like superfluous.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I don't think we need it.
Efrain Calderon: Um, and you know, the other thing is that we have this sort of filter, I guess, on the regular check-in where it'll show you things within 7 days and overdue. Um, and I'm just curious
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: whether like it's useful to see seven days of work of regular check-ins or is there a better way or I don't know.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I I would rather because come Friday, like last week, it was almost disappoint.
 
 
00:18:53
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It was like the end of Friday, I want to see that everything's out of my inbox. I did everything.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's like, you
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: know, seven days. It's just it's never done. Like there's always people like a little nerve-wracking like, well, was I supposed to have
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: called that person? You know, like on first. So, it's I don't love that. I wish it was just Monday to Friday
Efrain Calderon: So, it sounds like um possibly you're you're good about keeping your email inbox to zero as well. Like kind of like that that feeling of like, okay, cool. I've I've
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: accomplishment.
Efrain Calderon: done my work for the week,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: right?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Like it just it never it doesn't and maybe it's just like just me but it just doesn't feel good.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Like come
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: come the end of the week I want there to be every I did everything it's done and it's you never get that feeling.
 
 
00:19:42
 
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. No, I can see how that would be um kind of disheartening, especially at the end of the week. Um,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. And I only have again like 50 members. RCHPs have 110 members. The care coordinator has up to two
Efrain Calderon: wow.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: nightmare list. And you know, which is another reason why I would really like to see once these two attempts are made,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: get them out of the inbox because it just it's overwhelming. Who did I not make an attempt on yet? you know, so it's just a lot
Efrain Calderon: And
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: of people
Efrain Calderon: um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: in the
Efrain Calderon: can
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: inbox
Efrain Calderon: we pop into
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: all
Efrain Calderon: a member like 360 page back in there?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: Um and like we were talking about this briefly, but would love to hear in your words like the things you like or dislike about any of the changes.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like the regular check-in date being there.
 
 
00:20:37
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Uh this see appointments being very like specific appointments. It doesn't need to be every
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: appointment like the annual the annual provider visit important visit important the H important
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that they have a phone call with pharmacist not really important
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: you know it just doesn't I don't need to know that it's very easy for me to go in here it look because the things that I'm tracking
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: those three visits it's the HR the APV and the TOC so if I'm trying to find out when the last time this member had an APV It's not I know
Efrain Calderon: Hey
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: because it's I keep track. It's more difficult to go very specifically for an APV or HR or the IC. So I think those three dates would be more useful than just all of these every dates. Um I like what the that's nice. Um I like that they put that back on. That's new. They they had taken the team off.
 
 
00:21:48
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So that's um I don't use this panel at all. The upcoming and overdue tasks. It's not useful. I hate
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it
Efrain Calderon: Can you tell me why?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: because there's no point in looking at it there. There's I'm going to go into the care plan. I'm going
Efrain Calderon: And
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: to look at look at the care plan. See if there's anything overdue. See if there's any what do I have to do for this member today? There's no point to me just looking at this random ta list of tasks because there's no context to it. There's no like, well, what does this mean? You like, what goal am I working on here? You know, so I still need to go and see if the goals are going to expire. So, I still need to go in the care plan anyway.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. Yeah. So, it sounds like the value like your tasks mean a lot more if they're in the context of a goal.
 
 
00:22:34
 
Efrain Calderon: So, when you just list them out like that, it's not really as valuable.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's not at all. And
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it just takes up so much. I'd rather see this primary care team member come right back up here because when I'm assigning out things, you know, cuz I take care of the queue like the and the um incoming whatever queue when I go to a member's chart, I need to know who am I assigning that task to. So, it's nice to know who the primary is and I can find the rest of the team very easily if I really need to. But having that quick information here would be more helpful than having all these tasks here for sure.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, that makes that makes sense. um going up to the uh you know we've got the regular check-in due date and we have the number of attempts but I mean maybe you know this but it the the check-in cadence will sort of change depending on different factors right
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It'll
 
 
00:23:24
 
Efrain Calderon: um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: on their acuity. Okay.
Efrain Calderon: yeah and so what I'm curious is whether it'd be valuable for you to see that anywhere like um I mean you may know this just because you've been working through this right like how many days between if there's such and such acuity or such and such track.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: But
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I mean I could see that being useful for especially for new people who are just you like trying to figure out what what does moderate mean? Like how often am I calling? So yeah, that you know I could see like regular attempt due 421 and then you know
Efrain Calderon: number of attempts or
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: attempt
Efrain Calderon: something
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: by
Efrain Calderon: saying like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like attempt
Efrain Calderon: x
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: by
Efrain Calderon: amount.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: yeah
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like 40 you know 42 days or whatever it is um or attempt due in 42 days or something like that or however many it is.
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Um let's for this next sort of like question slashtask um that I'd love to see you perform I guess is like um well you mentioned that you usually will look at tasks um on the care plan.
 
 
00:24:25
 
Efrain Calderon: So
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: if you if you want to go there um let's imagine there was a task that you couldn't complete either because the member refused or like you know they just weren't interested in doing that. I'm just curious like what you would do next with that task.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So I mean the tasks themselves are I make them. So I make them so that I can complete them I guess. Um, so I I tell myself what I'm doing next time. So it'll be, you know, check on this, check on that, whatever. But when the nurses create their care plans, sometimes the tasks don't make sense. It'll say like sometimes they'll write, you know, check in with member weekly on blood sugar. Meanwhile, that's not something we're doing. Like I'm not calling anybody weekly ever. So
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I will uh edit the I'll just edit the task to say, you know, check in for acuity or whatever it is. Um, if let's say I I'm talking to Diane and she says, "I don't want to work on my my gastrointestinal. I
 
 
00:25:22
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: don't want to work on this anymore. Like, I'm good. We don't need to keep talking about it." I would archive the goal.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, it's not something
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Hey,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: she
Efrain Calderon: don't
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: wants.
Efrain Calderon: don't do don't
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'm
Efrain Calderon: do
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: not
Efrain Calderon: that
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: going
Efrain Calderon: for
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: to do
Efrain Calderon: real.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it now, but it's just ruin my whole care plan. But, it'll be a reason. It'll be say, "Why do you want to archive?"
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: And it's, you know, member doesn't want to work on it or whatever. Um, but
Efrain Calderon: Would
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: the
Efrain Calderon: there
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: task
Efrain Calderon: ever Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like
Efrain Calderon: Would there ever be a case where you'd have to like, you know, no long that a task would no longer be either not started or completed or in progress or anything
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Uh
Efrain Calderon: like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I
Efrain Calderon: that?
 
 
00:25:52
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: mean there definitely could be like sometimes they'll the errands will make it to like they they have the autopop populated tasks that come in with each of the goals like you know refer to nutritionist or something like that and the members like I don't want to go to a nutritionist. Um, so I would either in my know right you know like hey we talked about it they don't want to so I would complete the task but now we have the option to archive it and we can say you know member doesn't want to work on that or whatever the case is that the reason why we're archiving that specific task. We never had that before.
Efrain Calderon: And um do you know what that like if you had to explain to someone Let's say I'm new on the team. Like what does it mean to archive something?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So it just means that there's a reason why we're basically cancelelling the task. like why why are we not going to be able to complete it?
Efrain Calderon: Have you taken a look at those reasons by any chance?
 
 
00:26:39
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I think so.
Efrain Calderon: I'm just curious if you got like a like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: if you took a look at that. I'd just love your reaction on just like the reasons if any of them
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: this is fine. Um permanent I mean I usually I don't really archive my this is new this is a new feature for us.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, so let's say we're doing inbound, one of the inbound comms, you know, questions and we have to make we have to make three attempts to call the member back for whatever it is they called in for. So if I'm not able to get in touch with the member, I would archive I would really archive the whole workflow, but I could archive
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that task and say, you know, couldn't be reached for this specific task. Um, permanent resident of LTC facility. I don't know why that would mean I can't reach them, but all right. Or task no longer applies. You know, it could be, you know, member doesn't want a nutritionist.
 
 
00:27:28
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Test doesn't apply. So, I'm going to I'm going to get rid of it that way. Um, if member,
Efrain Calderon: Gota.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: you know, doesn't want to talk to me, then I would archive my tasks to outreach the member because they don't want to. Um, disenroll.
Efrain Calderon: But it sounds like based on what you were saying like normally you're not archiving tasks. you're just sort of like solving that most of the tasks that you see would be either connected to a workflow or a goal and so then you just sort of address that. Is
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Right.
Efrain Calderon: that right?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. So I mean like again I create my except for the when the nurses create it initially for the care plan when they make the care plan I make my tasks. So every so on March 13th I'm going to ask her like what's your blood pressure been
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like? Are you still taking your medications? Is it still this? And then when we talk about it I'm going to complete it.
 
 
00:28:15
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'm gonna duplicate it and I'm going to do it again next week or next, you know, next year. So, I make it very tailored to myself
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: um because it's kind of helpful for me to know, well, how am I helping the member with that goal? So, I
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: make it very specific for myself. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Cool. Um I know we're at time. I just have a couple more questions if you don't mind. It's not that much longer. Um I guess like yeah, if you could change one thing about all these updates that have kind of rolled out, what would be that change?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: um, get rid of when these attempts are made, get them out of the car and get them out of here.
Efrain Calderon: And if you had to say if you had to say why, like I know you kind of explained it, but like I don't know like why why would that be? And this is all anonymous and like
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Oh, I
 
 
00:29:03
 
Efrain Calderon: I
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: don't
Efrain Calderon: don't
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: care.
Efrain Calderon: know what
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I'll tell everybody I hate it. Uh, I don't care
Efrain Calderon: fair.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: because it just doesn't need to be there. Like once
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it's done, like I And the thing is like if if this members do like there are members that we've called already ahead of time, right? So
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like let's say that I'm calling this member because they called me and I'm calling them back and now I'm going to try my acuity because I'm trying to get back in touch with them. We have members who are like squirrely. Like they call in like, "Oh, I need to talk to you." And then you call them back and they don't answer the phone. Like, "Okay,
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: well,
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: don't call me." Uh, but I'm not calling them again next week. I I did
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: my time. You're like, "I did my time. I
 
 
00:29:39
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: tried." Like, get it get it out of get it out of the inbox because then it's just clogging up the inbox. And again, this not bad for me because I have 50 members, but for my care team, this is
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: a this is a nightmare to look at. You know, Kim has 200 members. She probably has, you know, 10 people do every day. So, I mean, she's going
Efrain Calderon: Wow.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: to just be looking at like a non-stop. And then if she's trying to go ahead and plan for say vacation, like I have, we have a CHP that's planning to be away for 3 weeks. So, she's trying to like call all these people ahead of time, her inbox is probably a nightmare because she's got to like, oh, she's made these two attempts, but now she's got to weed through and see who well, who else did I not make an attempt on? And, you know, so it's just it's a little obnoxious. Like, it can go away.
 
 
00:30:21
 
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's a lot. It's a lot to look at.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. And then sort of on that sort of related right the same thing of how it's um sort of this rolling 7-day thing.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: It never reduces. Um, so would you say the changes have improved your workflow with regular check-ins? Um, haven't made much of a change or have been neutral to it or have made it harder.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, harder because now we have to make two attempts for every time which is just obnoxious. Um,
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I don't I mean I know it's part of the gig. it's what we do. But most of us for the most part, we don't have a lot of members that are not we're not connecting with. So like having to make that extra outreach could just be really like I don't know would make me hate. I wouldn't want to talk to me either. Don't call me twice. That's rude. Um I don't know.
 
 
00:31:08
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's just rude. But I mean I I again I do like
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that it's it's here. It's it's this you know I know who's in my inbox. It's very similar to me having to come in here in my my dashboard and say, "Okay, this is you know who I'm looking at to call this week." So, it's it's very similar. It's right here. It's much easier for each CHP to not have to go and filter through the dashboard all the time. So, I do like that. I don't like that it's not filterable by CHP because I'm not Nicole's like, I'm not coming in tomorrow.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Well, who
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: am I
Efrain Calderon: You
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: calling?
Efrain Calderon: were you were showing that. So it's like it sounds like on the old dashboard that was much easier to look for and now you've kind of lost that. So that's probably a way it's made it harder.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Like I could filter this by I could filter this by and know like well when Marcy is out for
 
 
00:31:53
 
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: three weeks, you know, I can go in and just be like, okay, week so I can plan and add them into my day and I can, you know, do all of that. So it was just so much easier to know who and I don't know really why that I don't know what the management dashboard looks like. Like there's stuff that Gary can do that I can't. From what he showed me, it looks horrible. Um then he can have it.
Efrain Calderon: in
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: But
Efrain Calderon: terms of just like same thing like getting
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: you
Efrain Calderon: information
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: know
Efrain Calderon: about like who's due for what kind of stuff.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: about whom you
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah. pretty. Yes. So it just it looked really but didn't see it in action so I don't know. He just showed me a screenshot of it and
Efrain Calderon: Well,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it looked
Efrain Calderon: we we
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: really
Efrain Calderon: randomized
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: horrible.
Efrain Calderon: a bunch of folks to reach out to from the from the group and we did it by roll too.
 
 
00:32:39
 
Efrain Calderon: So hopefully we'll we'll get some insights too from the you know from from those kind of views and the more interesting views.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: And I'm pretty sure Gary's meeting with you this week, too.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Um, if you had to quantify this, I know this is like a little corny, but like if you had to go from like a scale of one to five in terms of like how much farther do you feel the workflow is now given all the changes even including because I know you you mentioned some of it isn't necessarily the product, but it's just like the process of like calling some times now. Um, one to five with one being like not much harder to like five being like way way way harder. Um, what would you kind of like number it?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, for me personally, it's probably more like a two. It's not that much harder for me to call a couple of people extra because I know that there are people every dime that are just not going to answer. I just, we all have those members.
 
 
00:33:28
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um, I think probably if I had more members, it would be
Efrain Calderon: more.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: more
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: obviously. Um, I mean, one of my one of the best is struggling because you know, like we always kind of hope that somebody's not going to answer. I know that's not the right thing to do, but like when you have to make 10, 12 calls a day, you hope that somebody doesn't answer, but when you
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: call them again, they're like, "Oh, you must really need to talk to me." It's like, "I really didn't want to talk to you, but okay." And then they'll call back or they're, you know, they email back and it's like you're
Efrain Calderon: Now
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: inviting
Efrain Calderon: you have less time to hit
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: now
Efrain Calderon: the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: you
Efrain Calderon: rest of the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: less
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: time. So, you know, our CHPs are overburdened already. So,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: having to do all these extra calls is just I think it's just annoying.
 
 
00:34:09
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: but I mean, I understand the point, you know, the reason behind it. It's just it's a lot. But then I think, you know, having to look at it and never feeling like, you know, the attempts that I'm doing and the work I'm doing today, like it's not I'm not going to know if it mattered until tomorrow when it all goes away. And it's I think
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it's it's overwhelming visually just to look at all of this. So, I don't
Efrain Calderon: That's
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: like
Efrain Calderon: an
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that.
Efrain Calderon: interesting point though. Yeah. Like you wouldn't see, let's say, all the good work you did to get to those two attempts on the due date until the next day. And even then, you just sort of see the fact that they're not there anymore.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: Um,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it's
Efrain Calderon: versus
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: just
Efrain Calderon: like them going away in the moment,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I just
Efrain Calderon: you know,
 
 
00:34:47
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: want it to go away. Like I did it. I tried like let me move on to something else. But it's just you still have to like look, okay, well, did I actually call everybody? You know, is everything done?
Efrain Calderon: right?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's just it's really visually overwhelming and I don't like that.
Efrain Calderon: Anything else you'd like to share that we didn't get a chance to talk about in terms of changes to 360 page or regular check-in or to the inbox or regular check-in stuff or anything like that?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, I definitely like I would like to see this panel go away.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's useless if you put the team panel there instead and just had that little tiny like who's the primary. I think that would be much like much more functional and useful.
Efrain Calderon: So,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Um,
Efrain Calderon: if if you just relied on, let's say, like the care plan, right, to see like um I guess what I'm saying, what I'm trying to understand is like how do you how do you like let's say you land on the 360 page, right, and there's no more upcoming overdue task panel.
 
 
00:35:39
 
Efrain Calderon: Like, let's say it's gone. Um,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: there's no more what? I'm sorry. It was breaking up
Efrain Calderon: sorry,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: a little bit.
Efrain Calderon: the Yeah, we're both mad. the the upcoming overdue tasks like you said, hey, I would get rid of this and I would just have the teams panel there or the teams widget. Um, let's say this is gone. Um, is there any way that you would know whether something is like an overdue task?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah, you just go right into the care plan. It's
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: right there
Efrain Calderon: And you would just scroll through and look for
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: for sure.
Efrain Calderon: um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah, I definitely will. It's just any like they always encourage us whenever we're making a phone call to go into the care plan to see if one if because the nurses are now giving us three month goals which is absurd because nobody ever completes a goal in three months. So now you know the goals are expiring.
 
 
00:36:24
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So you got to make sure your goals aren't expired anyway. So you have to go in the care plan and while you're in there like there's no reason why I mean it comes up red when it's overdue. So it's very easy to see that it's overdue.
Efrain Calderon: What happens when the goals expire? I'm just curious. This isn't even part I'm just curious because you
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Then
Efrain Calderon: mentioned
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it
Efrain Calderon: it
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: just
Efrain Calderon: seems
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: show
Efrain Calderon: to be happening
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: um
Efrain Calderon: a
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: who
Efrain Calderon: lot.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: did I see? It'll just it'll show like there will be no it'll say over um expired extend
Efrain Calderon: Uhhuh.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: or something like that. And then the members tasks will be past due because the members task usually this one isn't but it's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, it's like related to the goldie,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: it lines
Efrain Calderon: right?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: up. Yeah. So like
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I would line this up with the end of the goal.
 
 
00:37:02
 
Efrain Calderon: So then how does um how does that work? Like like um do you just cancel the goal or do you continue it and just change the due date or how do you handle
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So, we
Efrain Calderon: that?
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: can't um so like let's say Diane this goal was expired. I
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: would have to I can't do anything unless I speak to Diane because I need to know is the goal actually complete. Maybe she did complete it and then I can complete it and
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: be like great, you did a great job. um or you know I didn't get to do that yet or you know it's I'm not done with that so I want to continue it in which case we would then archive it as we can either complete it because they completed it or archive the goal and say the reason why um it's expired and unmet is typically what we're going to use for that and then if it's a clinical goal we have to go CHPS have to go to nursing hours and say hey you know Diane didn't complete her gastro blah blah blah goal and she wants to keep working on it and we keep adding it in. And so then we add it back in.
 
 
00:38:02
 
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Um, well, thank you so much for all your feedback. I I want you to know that like basically my my role right in this whole process as like a product designer the way we think about things is like helping users right and you know that's kind of a weird word but like helping users meaning like help people that are using either the products or the processes that we're like designing or we're helping design because really it's like a whole group. So like you know from my perspective you all are like my primary users people you know like folks that I want to help and you know I used to work customer service at a healthcare company so like I know a little bit about how it could be chasing down folks. I know you all have more specialized kind of like clinical goals and stuff. Um, but like I don't know, it's just very helpful and I appreciate the fact that you're candid because it gives me that fuel to be able to kind of like make it clear to people what's important to you all and why.
 
 
00:38:58
 
Efrain Calderon: Um, because the business might want one thing. Um, that's great, but we know that like you all are humans and also the people that you are calling are humans. So like something
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No.
Efrain Calderon: like the scaminess of stuff, right? like that might not make sense, but um our leaders may not also be on those calls where people are like, "Well, screw it. Then I'm not going to talk to City Block at all because they're
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No.
Efrain Calderon: fed up, right?" Um I think to work with people like that, you have to have this sense of like empathy and understanding how humans work. That may not always be the case when you're like super elite um leadership level. Um so that's where we have to well, I don't know, we try to um explain it step by step in a way that you'd be like, "Yeah, of course that makes sense." But like some people need the step by step of like this is why this is annoying.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: It's true. I mean, the further the CHPs are the backbone of this company.
 
 
00:39:49
 
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: They do all of
Efrain Calderon: 100%.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: the work. every single thing is
Efrain Calderon: 100%.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: CH's problem. So, I feel like the further you get away from that role and like even if you've been in that role before, they just forget. They forget what it's like to be in
Efrain Calderon: Wow.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: that role and to have all this s*** rolling downhill onto them and like
Efrain Calderon: Plus it's like it's not just that. It's like, okay, your welcome activities, your regular check-in tasks, your you got to schedule these appointments. I'm like, how do how do people actually, you know, and I can see like on your scratch pad you're like, you got these things listed of what you're doing and it's like it's so hard. But
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: I
Efrain Calderon: um
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: for everybody and that's why I would like to see so Gary and I were were supposed to be like trying to pilot some sort of panel that's for HRA scheduling because we have like this expectation for how often we're calling
 
 
00:40:33
 
Efrain Calderon: Sure.
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: people for HR scheduling. I track it manually. So, it's like they called on this date and this date and this date and this date and this date and this and I just it's all and everybody's scratch pad looks like crazy when they're in the H scheduling window. It's like there's no reason for it. Make it automatic.
Efrain Calderon: Well, the good thing is
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: So,
Efrain Calderon: I'm on the scheduling team as well. So that is something that you know in my head I'm like okay well this I if well that's more the attempt. So it's not that it's been scheduled, but you imagine if something was scheduled, how can we make that easy to like, you know, a lot of times we capture data at Cityblock, but then like it doesn't speak to other things when it when it should, right? Um, but you know, also part of it is like, you know, we're being rep prioritized on things and stuff like that. I'd like to improve things on scheduling, but then it's like you get a mandate on like ways of working.
 
 
00:41:18
 
Efrain Calderon: You're like, okay, cool. I guess we'll help with that. So I mean, it's it's probably similar. It's different, but it's like similar where it's like focus on H. Okay, wait. No, we have to focus on these numbers
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Oh yeah,
Efrain Calderon: and focus
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: this
Efrain Calderon: on
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: is the most important thing.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Everything
Efrain Calderon: everything
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: can't be
Efrain Calderon: is
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: the
Efrain Calderon: the
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: most
Efrain Calderon: most
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: important
Efrain Calderon: important
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: thing.
Efrain Calderon: thing. Exactly. So, well, thanks
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: so much for your help. Um, I may reach out with follow-up questions. If you have any questions for me, feel free to just send me a message anytime. And I may not be able to fix it. This is what I always say, like I may not be able to fix it, but I might know someone who could, and we're always trying, but it's like it's a whole group thing here, you know, one one person alone. I can't. It'd be very different if I could but it might not be made. That makes sense for business, either. They probably know things. I know what that stuff. So,
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: No, I totally get it.
Efrain Calderon: All right, have
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: a good rest of your day. Hopefully, you get those calls people picking up or
Sarah Kaluhiokalani: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: not, whatever else. All right. Take care.

Summary
Cheryl Newbury reported significant workflow inefficiencies due to the new system, citing increased call volume (over 100 due on March 31st compared to a typical 20-30 due each week), the reintroduction of opted-out members. Key feedback included the inability to remove completed check-ins after 2 attempts and the persistence of "on hold" tasks, hindering efficiency and impacting member communication, particularly regarding call frequency and the system's prioritization of call volume over in-person care.  The team should investigate system improvements, focusing on a consolidated task view, eliminating unnecessary check-ins, and addressing data access delays within the Zeus system.


Details
* Work Process and Challenges: Cheryl Newbury described their daily workflow in the comments section, noting significant changes due to new system implementations. They previously prioritized urgent tasks and check-ins, but the new system requires checking four tabs and has created inefficiencies, particularly with a large influx of calls (over 100) due unexpectedly on March 31st (00:01:13).  The new system also re-introduced individuals previously marked as hard-to-reach and opted out (00:03:12).  They expressed frustration with the redundancy and the increased workload compared to a typical week (00:02:26).
* March 31st Call Volume:  The new system unexpectedly assigned over 100 calls due on March 31st, significantly more than a typical week's volume of 20-30 calls (00:02:26).  Many of these individuals were previously marked as hard-to-reach and had been sent hard-to-reach letters the previous month.  This caused a large increase in workload and resulted in the reintroduction of individuals who had opted out of contact or had many previous unsuccessful contact attempts (00:01:13) (00:03:12).
* System Usability Feedback: Cheryl Newbury expressed a strong preference for a consolidated view of all tasks and check-ins, rather than the current four-tab system.  They found that the separation of regular check-ins from other tasks did not improve efficiency (00:04:23).  They also suggested that completed regular check-ins should be removed from the list, as their persistence created unnecessary scrolling and task management (00:07:02). The current "within seven days" view was deemed acceptable, with a preference for a rolling seven-day view (Wednesday to Wednesday) to account for weekend tasks (00:09:17).
* "On Hold" Status and Regular Check-ins: The "on hold" tag, indicating a member is in the TOC (Transfer of Care) process, caused concern because tasks remain on the list even after the due date, despite being inactive. Cheryl Newbury explained their typical workflow involving canceling regular check-ins and creating new ones after receiving TOC handoff workflows, stating that the current system removes their autonomy and creates unnecessary red flags (00:11:32). The issue was identified as the inability to adjust or remove check-ins even when unnecessary or unwanted by the member (00:13:36).
* Member Communication and System Limitations:  Cheryl Newbury highlighted a conflict between the system's frequency of calls and member preferences. The system's focus on quantity of calls over quality of care and in-person interactions was criticized. They explained how frequent calls, even for minor reasons, could upset members and lead to severed ties (00:14:33).  The example of Sharon Jackson, who prefers monthly calls but receives far more, demonstrates this conflict (00:13:36).
* Quality of Care vs. System Metrics: The current system prioritizes phone call volume over in-person visits and meaningful interactions (00:17:12).  Cheryl Newbury emphasized the importance of in-person visits, where they provide more comprehensive care, like accompanying patients to appointments and advocating for them (00:18:25). This high-quality interaction, which is more valuable for members, is treated as unproductive time by the system (00:17:12).
* Zeus System Issues: Cheryl Newbury reported difficulties with the Zeus system, particularly regarding data access and update times. Accessing information requires a 24-hour delay, causing further inefficiency and impacting timely patient care (00:19:39).  The lack of consistency in the display of quality gaps, such as missing mammograms or vaccines, is also a problem (00:21:19).
* Assessment Tool Feedback: Cheryl Newbury found the "Essentials" assessment tool to be unhelpful and non-conversational, hindering personal connections with patients.  They stressed the value of the "Member 360" tool for comprehensive patient information over the assessments that provide limited data (00:23:18).

Cheryl / Efrain - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Efrain Calderon: Um, and uh, let me see here. If you could, would you mind um, sharing your screen? Um, and I'm just going to ask you some questions about kind of like how you how you work through the day.
Cheryl Newbury: Okay. You want me to go to comments?
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, if that's okay. Yeah. And um
Cheryl Newbury: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: All right. And I wanted you to check out um I guess like I would say like how do you usually start your day in comments? Life very
Cheryl Newbury: Um, so what I usually do is I go to my inbox and um, now I mean it's I I absolutely understand and support the idea behind what you guys have done, but I never had any trouble keeping up. I worked in the ER
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Cheryl Newbury: for 25 years. So,
Efrain Calderon: Wow.
Cheryl Newbury: I have no issue I had no issues keeping up. So, now I've had to totally change the way that I normally work.
 
 
00:01:13
 
Cheryl Newbury: And um it's kind of screwing with my head. So, what I normally do is now I go to my regular check-ins. I check those out first. um and do what I need, you know, look and see what's up there. I check my due today because that's going to show me my urgent check-ins, my mic follow-ups, and that kind of thing. I'll get those two things done first. Then I will look at my due this week to see what's what's cooking there. And um I kind of look at my tasks to see, you know, what else is going on. And right now I am working on this awful March 31st list that we
Efrain Calderon: Can
Cheryl Newbury: all
Efrain Calderon: you
Cheryl Newbury: got.
Efrain Calderon: tell me? Yeah. Can you tell me why it's awful or what?
Cheryl Newbury: Um, well, what it did was it's kicking up all of these people that last month I already sent hardto-reach letters to, and it's just kicked all of those people back into the calling cadence.
 
 
00:02:26
 
Cheryl Newbury: I'm
Efrain Calderon: So
Cheryl Newbury: calling
Efrain Calderon: are
Cheryl Newbury: people that we have not contacted or been able to reach since 2023.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. So it's like grouping all these folks that have been hard to reach now all of a sudden and like they're all due on March 31st. Seems
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah, it kicked out um over a hundred people for me to call on March 31st by call twice by March 31st
Efrain Calderon: Uh just so that I have a sense of like how that compares to like a typical week. Um, so if if this March 31st group is like a hundred people, like like usually how much will it be in a week to do like regular chips?
Cheryl Newbury: in a week. Maybe 20 or 30
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. So that's like
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: more
Cheryl Newbury: I
Efrain Calderon: than
Cheryl Newbury: mean,
Efrain Calderon: double
Cheryl Newbury: that's in a week.
Efrain Calderon: easily.
Cheryl Newbury: This is in a day.
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: okay. Wow.
 
 
00:03:12
 
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Okay. Never mind.
Cheryl Newbury: It's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Cheryl Newbury: huge.
Efrain Calderon: that's a
Cheryl Newbury: And the
Efrain Calderon: lot more
Cheryl Newbury: other thing
Efrain Calderon: then.
Cheryl Newbury: is
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Cheryl Newbury: a lot of them um I just went through I got about a quarter of the way through the list and I had 10 that were opted out of services, do not contact that kicked back in. So,
Efrain Calderon: Well, yeah.
Cheryl Newbury: you know, I mean, it's just it's it's a lot of redundancy. One of the people on this list that kicked back to me, let me find her because I keep a spreadsheet of who I've called. Um, there's one on here that kicked in that's not consented, has never been reached or contacted since 2022, and they kicked back up for a regular uh check-in. I've got one that had five connection attempts in February and four in March and she kicked back in.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. So, these are folks that we've we've tried and tried.
Cheryl Newbury: Right. And I mean I think I gave Dedra probably 40 hardtoreach to send last month and all of those people have come back to call again.
 
 
00:04:23
 
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. Um well that's important to know. I mean I could um there's like different work groups, right? Like that are sort of thinking about different things as they come up. Um so I'll have to like double check and check in on that. I'm guessing that there's someone already sort of like aware of this and hopefully working towards a solution just because that's not really like reasonable to have a hundred people let's say do on the same day for for a single person. That's a
Cheryl Newbury: Right.
Efrain Calderon: lot.
Cheryl Newbury: Um, and then this the having the four tabs to check is just it's just not the way I worked. Um, well, what I did was I set it up, and I can still kind of do it this way. Um, I had, it's just my regular check-ins don't show up, but I had a view set up to do, and it just showed everything that needed to be done and my regular check-ins. It was on one list and I could just scroll through it and go down every day and look at what needed to be done and it was all on one page.
 
 
00:05:31
 
Efrain Calderon: So it uh it sounds like you know now this this work to like separate the regular check-ins from the other tasks. Um hasn't h how has that changed things for
Cheryl Newbury: It
Efrain Calderon: you
Cheryl Newbury: just
Efrain Calderon: then?
Cheryl Newbury: it just hasn't helped me because I'm not a flipper and I'm not one of those people that keeps a bunch of tabs open and and that kind of thing. And I've noticed with um especially one of my CHPs who cannot seem to be caught up for anything that this has not helped him at all. He's still behind on a bunch of stuff. That's okay. I would just like to be able to see everything on one page. Um, instead of having the regular check-in separated out. I like the way it has the two attempts. I like that a lot. Um, I would just like to be able to have everything on one page so I can look at it. So, like I have my to-do list. I can see everything I need to do today and tomorrow on one page because I like to plan ahead and make a list.
 
 
00:07:02
 
Cheryl Newbury: I just like how it shows me, okay, I don't have to because I work ahead and then I know, okay, that person's done now. I, you know, I can, now I can work ahead. Like, if I look at, if I look at my regular check-ins, I'm done with my check-ins for this week.
Efrain Calderon: So,
Cheryl Newbury: So now I know that I can focus on the folks that I'm well engaged with that I tend to call every week. I can focus on the hundred people I have to call by March 31st. I can, you know, I I know that this is done so I can move on with something else.
Efrain Calderon: Um, you know, we we've seen different um feedback even in like the Slack channel and stuff about like what should happen, let's say, if someone had already done the two attempts with people on this list. Um, did you have any opinion on that?
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah, I want it to go away. Yeah, if the two attempts are done, if I'm done with that regular check-in, I want it to go away.
 
 
00:08:10
 
Cheryl Newbury: I don't want it to be festering there anymore. it for me. It just kind of muddles things. Um because you know I so I do this and so these are all done and but I've still got to scroll through to see you know what I've got to do yet.
Efrain Calderon: So, it
Cheryl Newbury: Um
Efrain Calderon: sounds like if if you work ahead a little bit now, you've got to like keep an eye out for which ones are done, which ones aren't, which ones you got to go through next.
Cheryl Newbury: right. And um because before what we would do is we would make our two attempts and then we would just change the date to
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Cheryl Newbury: the next month and it would just bump it off the list.
Efrain Calderon: I love how um you know one of the views there in that that like selector on the top now you're showing due within 30 days.
Cheryl Newbury: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: One of them says do or sorry it says can you yeah can you select the first one says within seven days and overdue.
 
 
00:09:17
 
Cheryl Newbury: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: Um, from what I understand, this is like a rolling thing. Like, is it may not be the case for yours here. You might have just had some successful ones, but like does this show Okay, well, let me just ask. Uh, do you think this shows like everyone just from this week or will it show everyone for like the next seven days starting today, Tuesday the 11th?
Cheryl Newbury: Um the only the um from what I was told they only come off once the due date passes.
Efrain Calderon: Sure. Um,
Cheryl Newbury: So and I don't know about this TOC on hold. I don't know if that's going to sit there until she's out of TOC, but I know like these these for March 12th will not go away until March 13th. So,
Efrain Calderon: when
Cheryl Newbury: they're
Efrain Calderon: you think
Cheryl Newbury: gonna sit there and be on the list until the date passes.
Efrain Calderon: um when you think about planning your work and like the this is sort of like the default view. So like the moment you jump into like regular check-ins inbox, it shows this and right now we're showing it seems like within seven days.
 
 
00:10:32
 
Efrain Calderon: So meaning it could be from this Tuesday to next Tuesday.
Cheryl Newbury: Mhm.
Efrain Calderon: Do you have any opinion on whether it should be that way where like on Wednesday you got from Wednesday to next Wednesday versus saying um this is just going to show for this week meaning from Monday March 10th to Friday March the 14th.
Cheryl Newbury: Oh, I that doesn't matter to me.
Efrain Calderon: Okay. Um,
Cheryl Newbury: Well, and because some of the stuff does show up on weekends, so as
Efrain Calderon: great.
Cheryl Newbury: long as it, you know, so I know I think it it would be best to show it like from Wednesday to Wednesday. That way if something does fall on the weekend, you can get it done by Friday.
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Cheryl Newbury: So that way it's done early rather than late.
Efrain Calderon: Um, you mentioned the how like one of those says on hold. Um, and you you asked like, "Okay, well, does it stay? Does it does it go away past its date and everything?" Um, so we'll see that tomorrow.
 
 
00:11:32
 
Efrain Calderon: We'll see what happens. Um, but, uh, what what does that tag mean to you and and like Yeah, first I'll say like what do you understand the on hold TLC tag to be?
Cheryl Newbury: um that they're in the TOC process, which is great because a lot of times um if I go in to do a regular check-in and I'm, you know, redoing the research. Sometimes I'm not sure and Taylor and Matt are great because I'll slack them and say, "Hey, is this person in TOC?" And they're happy to tell me. They're very helpful. Um, but you don't want to step on any toes if somebody's in TOC. Um, this one I just happened to attempt to call her the day before she went into TC. Um, and she's one that she rarely answers the phone anyway. So whether or not Matt got a hold of her, I don't know. Um, but what will give me a twitch because it's my thing. Um, if this goes red and shows overdue, that's going to make me twitch because
 
 
00:12:43
 
Efrain Calderon: Grab it.
Cheryl Newbury: what I would normally do is she is on hold. So, what I would do is I would cancel the regular check-in
Efrain Calderon: Grab it.
Cheryl Newbury: because I'll get a task from whoever her TOC nurse is like Matt or whatever. Matt will assign me the TOC handoff workflow and then I would trigger the regular check-in for the same day.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha.
Cheryl Newbury: And then that way I don't have anything red or overdue because that is what is going to make me twitch.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, I mean it sounds like if something's on hold because of a TOC and now it's showing overdue, there's really not much you can do about it. So,
Cheryl Newbury: Right.
Efrain Calderon: it doesn't seem great to look at it on a dashboard
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah. It's
Efrain Calderon: here.
Cheryl Newbury: It's kind of like they they took away our autonomy on regular check-ins.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Cheryl Newbury: And I've
Efrain Calderon: that's
Cheryl Newbury: been doing this for 30 years. I'm a grown-up. I
Efrain Calderon: right.
 
 
00:13:36
 
Cheryl Newbury: you know, know what my job is.
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Cheryl Newbury: You know, it's like this one. This Sharon Jackson. um she does not want to be called more than once a month. And they said, "Well, maybe you should change her acuity." I'm not arguing with the acuity.
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Cheryl Newbury: What I'm saying is multiple people are calling her. She only wants to be called every 30 days. So, I should be able to change that check-in or cancel that checkin so I don't piss her off because she is
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, it sounds like that workaround suggestion of like change the acuey. It sounds like the problem is that sometimes the accut is right,
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah,
Efrain Calderon: but that
Cheryl Newbury: exactly
Efrain Calderon: has nothing to do with the fact that someone doesn't want to be called.
Cheryl Newbury: right. Yeah, she just doesn't want us to call her all the time, which I totally understand.
Efrain Calderon: Sir.
Cheryl Newbury: And the whoever it was that called her put in her note, member is really poed.
 
 
00:14:33
 
Cheryl Newbury: And I would rather, you know, be able to change that check-in date rather than have the member sever ties with us because we're bugging her.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Can you tell me more about that? Because like that was going to be my next question like just to do you know thought experiment. You've done this. You you know what what can happen. Let's say someone says don't call me more than 30 days and you call them more than 30 days.
Cheryl Newbury: They get really upset. Okay, so Sharon Jackson um you can see my note here. I researched it after I looked at Delibra's note um because you know she went to the ED, she was very irritated um with City Block wanting to know about her ER visit. She said we're invading her personal business. She's getting ped about all the phone calls. So I looked, we called her nine times in February. I mean, seriously, why are we calling the beeers out of this poor lady? And I was looking and the thing is is I understand the um I understand the TOC check-ins if they're inpatient, but I don't think TOC needs to check on somebody every time they go to the ER because a lot of times times.
 
 
00:16:08
 
Cheryl Newbury: Trust me, I was I worked in the ER for 25 years. They go to the ER for stupid stuff. That is something that I could follow up on and count it as a regular check-in. But you got, you know, so if they go to the ER once, TOC is going to call them three times. I'm going to call them twice for a regular check-in. That's five phone calls in a month.
Efrain Calderon: So it's like the difference could be again coming from healthcare knowing a little bit about definitely like this idea of like unnecessary you know I knew of people that would go to an ER because they needed a prescription refill right
Cheryl Newbury: Right.
Efrain Calderon: um that sounds different and something that you could help with versus a TOC which might be like you broke a bone you've got a new disease now you need to follow up care and set up see a specialist like there could be other things TOC team generally is that the sort of thing that the
Cheryl Newbury: Yes. because we have really fragile people that will be in TEOC for months because they just, you know, they're very sick and they keep going back to the hospital.
 
 
00:17:12
 
Cheryl Newbury: But then we've got folks that, God love them, they have kidney stones and that's truly the only people that can treat them are the is the ER. There's nothing that VU can do for a kidney stone. So, you know, if they have kidney stones and they do have to go to the ER several times in a month, that's, you know, how many phone calls? So, if it's something chronic, I can follow up on that and that frees up TOC to take care of the fragile people. Um cuz it's it really feels like and one of my CHPs was talking to me about it that we're moving a lot more towards quantity than quality because your member visits, the time you actually spend sitting on someone's couch with them, going through their medicines, explaining things, that doesn't count towards our productivity. The only thing that counts towards our productivity are those phone calls. And I've already made 30 phone calls today. I've talked to three people.
Efrain Calderon: I think that's really important what you're talking about and I I get this sense but I want to kind of like ask more about it, right?
 
 
00:18:25
 
Efrain Calderon: Like the difference between like you're saying like being there on the couch and reviewing medications with someone one-on-one uh versus like the phone calls.
Cheryl Newbury: Yeah. I mean, if you know, the people that need us and want to engage with us are going to answer the phone. Um, you know, but the people that need me to go to their house and sit down and just listen or explain things, that doesn't count, you know, that's
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Cheryl Newbury: that's like not that's counted as nonproductive time. And that should actually count as twice the productive time because I'm actually making a difference to that person. I'm not
Efrain Calderon: Right.
Cheryl Newbury: leaving a voicemail.
Efrain Calderon: So, it sounds like even even to the member themselves, they're going to value that more. You taking the time going over things versus leaving a voicemail. But our system is counting that voicemail as like productive work.
Cheryl Newbury: Right.
Efrain Calderon: unproductive work is the sort of personto person.
Cheryl Newbury: Right. Because I go
Efrain Calderon: Um
Cheryl Newbury: to doctor's appointments with people and
 
 
00:19:39
 
Efrain Calderon: yeah.
Cheryl Newbury: I, you know, and a lot of times I'm just a fly on the wall. Sometimes I can pull up lab. When we had Health Gorilla, I could pull up labs for the doctor if they were done elsewhere. I could pull up old results. Um, you know, I'm just an advocate. You know, I'm just sitting there, but I'm there for the patient if the patient's scared or nervous.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Cheryl Newbury: Unfortunately, Zeus is the only way. And um actually Ashley described it perfectly today. They put a bow on a tornado. Well, um, we were all really excited when they presented Zeus to us, but like when you want to update something, um, you have, first of all, you have to request the update and it can take up to 24 hours. So, I can't just quickly do something. And if you look at this, her most recent lab is from 2013. And with her, what? Well, yeah, I try to, but it takes 24 hours.
 
 
00:21:19
 
Cheryl Newbury: So, if I have to do something quick and like this lady, I just happen to know with Chiron that I uploaded a 2014 A1C into Athena when we did the whole A1C uh chase list, but um they're throwing me a 2013 A1C, but here's a 2025 CBC. So, where where's all the stuff in between? because it's not there. Oh. Um, let me find somebody. I here I just did I just chatted with Renee. Um, she's so sweet. Um, I noticed that some of them have like, okay, for Renee, some of them say annual flu vaccine mammogram. Some of them don't have the mammogram. Um, so for some reason, not all of the um not all of the um quality gaps are there for everybody cuz there really should be I mean she's a 47y old female. She should have a mamogram on here. Um because the new guidelines are once a year for women over 40. I still asked her about it. Um, but I it should be up here.
 
 
00:23:18
 
Cheryl Newbury: Um, oh, and I just saw this on St. Martins's. Um, actually, my nephew is a dentist and he volunteers there, so I'll ask him about that because that's what he does on his days off. So, he volunteers there, so I'll ask him about how she gets in there. Um, so yeah, that's something because not all that stuff is on there. And I mean really, okay, great, annual flu vaccine, that's fantastic. But, um, have they had the numovax if they're eligible? Have they had the shingles vaccine if they're eligible? You know, I think there are a lot more. There could be a lot more to this quality gap. Um, I don't mind the upcoming tasks. I don't mind the appointments. Um, the team is fine. I mean, this stuff is fine. This doesn't bother me. Um, I wish more people filled out the member 360 because this is really the best information you can have on a member, but not everybody fills it out. So, I try to Yeah.
 
 
00:24:40
 
Cheryl Newbury: totally blank. And that's the difference between that and the assessment that we do. The assessment is garbage. It tells me nothing I need to know. Yeah. Yeah. Because the assessment doesn't tell me crap. I need
Efrain Calderon: And
Cheryl Newbury: to know, do you live alone? Um, how do you do on your ADLs? What's your past medical history? What medicines? The 360 view, the member impression is what I need is what everybody needs to know.
Efrain Calderon: the
Cheryl Newbury: I
Efrain Calderon: the
Cheryl Newbury: don't care on a scale of one to 10 how much you trust your doctor.
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. Which Can you just let me know which assessment you're referring to in the assessment
Cheryl Newbury: Um
Efrain Calderon: section because there's a lot of
Cheryl Newbury: the
Efrain Calderon: them, but I just want to make sure I'm talking about the right one or
Cheryl Newbury: the
Efrain Calderon: I'm
Cheryl Newbury: essentials
Efrain Calderon: understanding.
Cheryl Newbury: right here
Efrain Calderon: Okay.
Cheryl Newbury: is pointless. Yeah, this one. It's silliness. And um also the pathway questions are also just silly because the pathway questions make it so it's not conversational.
Efrain Calderon: I'm here,
Cheryl Newbury: When you're asking someone score something on a scale of 1 to 10, you can't make it conversational. You can't make it sound like you're interested in them personally. It sounds like you're filling out a form.
Efrain Calderon: right? Yeah. If I was asking you about this page and I said on a scale of 1 to 10,
Cheryl Newbury: Okay.
Efrain Calderon: how whatever, suddenly it's like a survey versus like a conversation.
Cheryl Newbury: Right.
Efrain Calderon: Um, I know we're at time. Well, hold on. We just come and real quick. So

Summary
Melissa McNeil reviewed her daily workflow, highlighting discrepancies in acuity check-in dates and suggesting a three-day check-in view for improved efficiency.  She provided feedback on the Member 360 view, finding the care plan helpful but suggesting improvements to the "opportunities" box, and detailed her process for task management and closure, including using the "Zus" button for information refresh.  Melissa will continue to use her current workflow with the current system.


Details
* Melissa's Daily Workflow: Melissa McNeil begins their workday by reviewing their dashboard, prioritizing members needing immediate attention based on due dates (00:01:07).  They also check their 10 attempts, connections, and research notes to ensure data consistency.  They described their process as always checking the dashboard in the morning (00:02:05).
* Acuity Check-in Discrepancies:  A discrepancy exists between the acuity check-in dates and the regular check-in dates. Melissa manually adjusts the dates to reflect their preferred four-week calculation, rather than using the automated system (00:02:51) (00:14:48).  They explained this discrepancy in detail, showing how their calculation is done differently (00:16:02).
* Regular Check-in Process:  Melissa prioritizes regular check-ins based on member urgency. They suggested a three-day option for the check-in view instead of the current seven-day ongoing view, to better align with their workflow and reduce feelings of overwhelm. They prefer a shorter, more manageable view of their tasks (00:03:53).
* Member 360 View Feedback:  Melissa finds the Member 360 view's care plan and recent timeline notes helpful for preparing conversations with members (00:11:48). However, they find other aspects, like the "opportunities" box, less useful and visually overwhelming.  They found that the care plan "wraps it up a little bit better" (00:13:06) (00:25:16).
* Task Management and Closure: When a member declines a task (e.g., an annual provider visit), Melissa documents the reason in a note, attaches it to the task, and then marks the task as complete. They explained in detail how they would note the reasons for task declination (00:19:31).
* "Zus" Button Functionality: Melissa demonstrated the "Zus" button's functionality, which seems to refresh member information.  They noted this functionality as useful for updating information and is easily accessible (00:30:44).
* Workflow Efficiency:  Melissa stated that the current system hasn't made their workflow significantly easier or harder but involves more steps than their previous method (00:24:13). The extra steps are largely due to manually updating dates for acuity check-ins rather than using the automated system (00:22:31).
* Opportunity Box Usage: The opportunity box, while considered "nice," is viewed as primarily informational and less crucial than tasks in Melissa's workflow (00:25:16). They suggested that the opportunity box's location or formatting could be improved for better usability (00:27:48).  Melissa felt tasks were more important than opportunities in driving their work (00:26:43).
* Additional Call Steps: The increased number of required calls for acuity check-ins adds extra steps to Melissa's workflow (00:28:35).  While not overwhelmingly negative, it represents a change from their previously streamlined process.  They expressed this in terms of extra steps for existing tasks, and that it is less effective for someone already familiar with the previous system (00:29:40).
* Prior Workflow: Melissa's previous workflow relied on experience and familiarity to manage tasks and deadlines. They explained how they would know in advance of changes to the current workflow (00:29:40).

Melissa / Efrain - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Efrain Calderon: Um
Melissa McNeil: sure.
Efrain Calderon: but uh what I'd love to do is um have you share your screen
Melissa McNeil: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: and just ask you some some questions basically like pose scenarios to you and just kind of like um have you kind of talk us through how you think about different things and how you you work in different ways.
Melissa McNeil: Sure.
Efrain Calderon: Make sense?
Melissa McNeil: I guess so. The pressure. Um, just kidding. I'm fine. All right. Can you see it?
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, it's all good. Um, so I mean ultimately like you know before we kind of dive into specific stuff um I'm just curious like how you typically start your day in comments.
Melissa McNeil: So, when I go into comments, um, this is my member list obviously, you know, whatever. I usually and I know some people don't but I always have and I know this is one of the things that isn't um meshing is the dashboard um like lining upwise.
 
 
00:01:07
 
Melissa McNeil: So this is my originally it was broken but it was since fixed so now I can just see my stuff. So that that worked out. Um, so you know this stuff you don't really kind of look at. You kind of know that information. This is like a list of the LTSC stuff and my member list, whatnot.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. So
Melissa McNeil: So,
Efrain Calderon: when you when you get here in the morning, like what are you looking for and and what's kind of like most important for
Melissa McNeil: yep. So, this is the most important. So, I usually go to this because this is my priority, right? like these people, I never want to be in the red here, right? So like Jeff, like these people are all due today. And it also helps me look at what's due tomorrow because I usually do that stuff today, too, right? And then what's due in the future so I can kind of count it out in my head. Um, so I kind of I always look at my dashboard in the morning.
 
 
00:02:05
 
Melissa McNeil: I look at and I know this doesn't always line up either, but I look at my tens, my 10 attempts, my connections from the past couple of days, right? This doesn't count today. This just the past couple of days. And then I look at, you know, research notes. I make sure like, you know, the number of ICTs matches what I've done, you know, stuff like that. But I always look at my dashboard in the morning
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. And
Melissa McNeil: and
Efrain Calderon: I
Melissa McNeil: throughout
Efrain Calderon: think Ryan
Melissa McNeil: the
Efrain Calderon: posed
Melissa McNeil: day.
Efrain Calderon: a question,
Melissa McNeil: Go ahead.
Efrain Calderon: but
Melissa McNeil: What?
Efrain Calderon: Ryan posed a question about that um minimum engagement panel like that that chart they were there. Is that the acuity check-ins?
Melissa McNeil: Yes. Yep. And they're
Efrain Calderon: Um
Melissa McNeil: not
Efrain Calderon: and
Melissa McNeil: lining
Efrain Calderon: so
Melissa McNeil: up with
Efrain Calderon: they're not lining up with what?
Melissa McNeil: um the in the rci um dates.
 
 
00:02:51
 
Melissa McNeil: So
Efrain Calderon: Um what Yeah. Or what is it that's not lining
Melissa McNeil: I'll show you. So say this is the due date. So, tomorrow they'll be in the red. They need to be done today. But Jeff, excuse me. Jeff on my regular check, I already did Jeff. I just did Jeff, so whatever. Jeff was due the 13th, but technically the 13th he would have been negative. You know what I'm saying?
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: So today's
Efrain Calderon: Um,
Melissa McNeil: day zero type of thing,
Efrain Calderon: so
Melissa McNeil: but I don't know if that really matters, but that's how I think. Um
Efrain Calderon: um, so I would say like let's take that next step. So you've you've um, you know, you've you've gone in, you've gotten your day started, you're on that dashboard. Now imagine um, you need to complete a regular check-in for a member. Where
Melissa McNeil: Yep.
Efrain Calderon: would you
Melissa McNeil: So obviously due today, I've already done my stuff for today, but I had nine
 
 
00:03:53
 
Efrain Calderon: Share.
Melissa McNeil: regular tasks. I completed those. It depends on priority, right? Whoever's important goes first. Um, regular check-ins. I've been looking at this. This is fine. I've learned how to navigate it. One of the things that I suggested, and it's just the way I work. This is a lot. And this doesn't ever go down. So, this is always it's always going to be seven days, right? So, I I' I'd like it if there was a three-day option.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. Can you tell me more about that? I know that um one option too that we've heard from folks, right, is like whether you see like an ongoing seven days like you're saying
Melissa McNeil: Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: um or like you see just this week or you see like you're saying like the next three days. I'm just curious in your words like why why that's important.
Melissa McNeil: So, the ongoing seven days, I think any normal person likes to complete it complete a to-do list, right?
 
 
00:04:53
 
Melissa McNeil: So, it's just ongoing. I think it's just forever ongoing. I think having an option to have it be that is fine, but I think that giving people the option to just have it be a snapshot of seven days or three days um you know, Sunday to Saturday like the work week type of thing is um is good for people to have as an option. You know what
Efrain Calderon: Now,
Melissa McNeil: I'm saying? Um
Efrain Calderon: how does it make you feel when you see this
Melissa McNeil: well, I don't like it. I want a three-day option. um or or five days, you know what I mean? Um I think it's because that's how I work. But if you continue to look at all this, it's just too much. You know what I mean?
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Melissa McNeil: It's just
Efrain Calderon: you mentioned overwhelm before like that everything was a bit too much. Um, you kind of hovered over the uh I guess the tracked labels. Is there anything here like is there anything um that you are seeing that you don't need to see that's here or anything that you would like to see that you don't
 
 
00:05:53
 
Melissa McNeil: um what I would like to see but I don't see or have the option to is having less days right here as an option. And also um I like the do today. You know I understand like how the separation is happening. Do this week also same thing. It's ongoing. So you think you're completing a lot of stuff and then like you know whatever. So it might be nice. Do this week isn't necessarily this week.
Efrain Calderon: I
Melissa McNeil: It's part
Efrain Calderon: see.
Melissa McNeil: of next
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: week too now, right? So it's not
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: true to statement. So I, you know,
Efrain Calderon: How about the information in the actual rows? Like you've got um an avatar here, like sort of the initials, you've got the member's name. I guess that's the track. Uh, can you tell me anything about what's on the right side there and how do you use it or think
Melissa McNeil: um, again, these these are just off by a day compared to my dashboard, but that's fine because
 
 
00:06:46
 
Efrain Calderon: Mhm.
Melissa McNeil: I can I know that's they're not connected well yet, but um I I don't mind it. I like it showing the two attempts. I understand that. So, Meline, I've made two attempts. She's not due till today, so I know that she's not going to go away till tomorrow. I understand people don't like that, but whatever. It is what it is. Um, yeah, I don't mind it. I think it's it's it's pretty organized. I just would like a smaller snapshot or the option to um you know focus in more on the actual work week or work you know what I mean a smaller view um instead of the bigger view but you can always have that option right but um I did have a member oh no he's gone yeah I'm not it's not that bad for me um I think it might I think I mentioned the things that I would want. Um, which is that and kind of like just making this more streamlined to be the week.
 
 
00:07:53
 
Melissa McNeil: Um,
Efrain Calderon: just the week instead of like an ongoing seven days. Is that it?
Melissa McNeil: yes.
Efrain Calderon: Can you click into that to do this week?
Melissa McNeil: Yep. So,
Efrain Calderon: Gotcha. Do within seven calendar days. I see that. Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: yeah. So that's always going to be which you know it's fine as if it's an option but if it's going to you know what I mean why not have the other option too you know
Efrain Calderon: Can you go back to the regular check-ins folder
Melissa McNeil: y
Efrain Calderon: and can you tell me like um like Meline, right? What can you tell me about that first person on your list?
Melissa McNeil: so Meline um she
Efrain Calderon: I'm
Melissa McNeil: tends
Efrain Calderon: sorry
Melissa McNeil: to
Efrain Calderon: if you can go back to the inbox. I meant more from like the inbox perspective.
Melissa McNeil: Sure. No, that's fine. Yeah. No. So, I know that Meline's more of an intensive person because she had a recent um ED visit similar to or Jeff or has a recent TOC or MIC or whatever it may be.
 
 
00:09:03
 
Melissa McNeil: Um and Mike. Um, so that information is there. Um, I can call her again today, um, as a third attempt um, prior to her going away tomorrow, right? Um, so that's it depends on the member. Um, and it depends on like the research I've done or whatnot. Um because Meline is somebody that tends to not answer. Um it depends on the member. I kind of want to say um you know calling them and leaving them a voicemail and a text and a um I feel like sometimes too depending on the member if you've called them left a voicemail and also sent them a text message that third attempt may be overkill um depending on the person. Um um history um depending on I I pretty much know my people really well. Um I I speak to them often. The newer people I'd probably make the additional third attempt whether it's email, text, phone, but you know you also don't want to scare people. I've worked in human services, mental health, and all that for a couple of decades now.
 
 
00:10:45
 
Melissa McNeil: So, you know, you do push some people away. Um,
Efrain Calderon: So when you say like history, is that what you mean? like that you that sometimes if you've called more than you you think the person can handle or whatever that it pushes them away or
Melissa McNeil: of course. Yep. Yep. Or it's just too much for them. Or or you know their their daily schedule, right? or they're what they're doing. So, Kylie, I've outreached her twice. She works till 5:15. So, I've sent a text. I've called her. I think I've emailed her previous. Well, not only with her acuity, I had to call her for um a flu shot question. I had to introduce myself. I had to because she was newer to me. So, I've physically tried to attempt to communicate with her five times in the past week, it seems. You know what I mean? So, that's a little
Efrain Calderon: Is it that ultimately Kylie's going to have to find time during her workday to talk to you?
 
 
00:11:48
 
Efrain Calderon: Is that
Melissa McNeil: Yeah. And I've texted her. I gave her that option. Um, there's email,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: you know what I mean? And there's other options. So, um, you know, it's it's generally successful. people generally do connect with us, but there's some that don't, you know. Um, I don't think she will be somebody that doesn't. Eventually, she will, but you know, she's not no longer interested, but
Efrain Calderon: Um I have some questions now about like the member 360 view.
Melissa McNeil: sure. Any you want to go to a regular check-in? Sure. So, I tend, you know, it's good to see their acuity. Of course, I like that there. I like this um appointments right here um just to see like I know Meline's due for an upcoming HR um also because I add this information here, but um she doesn't have it. So, I know I need to schedule that with her or have been attempting to. And that information is right here as well.
 
 
00:13:06
 
Melissa McNeil: I haven't like I take a peek at this, but ultimately before I call my member or someone else's member or whatever it may be, I look at the care plan and the recent timeline notes um to prepare for the conversation so I know what's upcoming, what they need, what they're working on. Um, anything down here that needs to be worked on? Huh? Um, yeah. I think, um, I'm a visual person. This isn't I don't know why, and don't take this the wrong way. It's just not just not I'm not I don't know jing with it. I think it's um I think that the care plan just kind of wraps it up a little bit better, right? It's the actual goal. It's the format that it's in. It's bigger. It's in your face. It's I don't know. Um, this just kind of seems, you know, like overkill. I don't know. Yep. I might that. But um I like it. No, no, that's fine.
 
 
00:14:48
 
Melissa McNeil: I like, you know, in the member impression, obviously, you can access a lot of the information. Um, I know someone mentioned updated med list, but I'm not a nurse, so I don't necessarily need that all the time. And that can be found in other areas. Um, this is working out. I always check it after I've make to make sure it's all set. The one thing I do have to say, oh, I forgot to mention this. So, the reg, so when you complete an acuity check-in, I'm not hitting the um calendar that says the blue but I'm not hitting the blue pill that says to line it up with the regular check-in because it's off by two days. Uh, sure. Sure. Um, I guess so. I'm not hitting this. So, say this was her Oh, wait. Never mind. Let me get out of that. Her acuity check-in is due on April 8th as of right now, right after these two attempts were made. Um, when I was doing it, if I hit regular check-in, she would have been due on the 10th at because it's looking at four weeks.
 
 
00:16:02
 
Melissa McNeil: But how I count four weeks. So say if somebody's a severe person, right? They need to be done in four weeks. I go, so say I talk to her on the first, it would be 1 2 3 4. You know what I mean? And then if you hit this, it's not counting like that.
Efrain Calderon: So, is it fair to say that you just haven't used the this kind of like feature for your task?
Melissa McNeil: I tried to use it, but it's not lining up.
Efrain Calderon: It's like
Melissa McNeil: So
Efrain Calderon: once
Melissa McNeil: I
Efrain Calderon: you noticed that change, you said, "Okay, this isn't
Melissa McNeil: Yep.
Efrain Calderon: lining up the right way."
Melissa McNeil: Yep.
Efrain Calderon: Um, the I also noticed that task that says acuity checkin. Is that a task you created?
Melissa McNeil: Yeah. I do it for myself um because it helps you and others if they need to cover your stuff know that that person like that's that is the main task, right? That encompasses all these other ones, right?
 
 
00:16:52
 
Melissa McNeil: You're calling the person
Efrain Calderon: And how do you know?
Melissa McNeil: Oh yeah. Um well, I try to hit on everything, you know. Um sometimes the person obviously can't and wants to focus on certain things, which is fine. I sometimes send myself reminder tasks to follow up on certain things. Ultimately, in my note, I'll summarize our conversation and put follow-up tasks that I need to do. And then if I talk to the person and they need certain resources, I I in a perfect world do them right after we hang up, right? And send them the way they wanted them sent, whether it's via text or email or or whatever it may be. Um Yeah.
Efrain Calderon: How how about if we return to the 360 view real quick?
Melissa McNeil: Mhm. Oops. Oh, I got out of Meline. Does it matter?
Efrain Calderon: No worries. It could be any number.
Melissa McNeil: Date that it's due, number of attempts, regular check-in due. It's pretty straightforward. I don't know what else somebody would be looking for.
 
 
00:18:23
 
Melissa McNeil: Um,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah. One thing we've thought about.
Melissa McNeil: you could write HR when the HRA is due. Um, or like the APV and that, you know what I mean? Like you could
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: put that there. Um,
Efrain Calderon: And and is that I mean I've heard that from a few folks where it's important for them to schedule those um annual provider visits or the I don't know if it's health risk assessment, high risk assessment, but those HASS.
Melissa McNeil: So, we have a task for it, but we also in our own pods have an HRA tracker um form and we follow it that way by month and we know the date. So, and you can also go in here and look. She's
Efrain Calderon: Oh,
Melissa McNeil: overdue.
Efrain Calderon: okay.
Melissa McNeil: She's well overdue. She's not a great person to show, but um it's usually right here.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: So So
Efrain Calderon: How about um for another question I have? Let's say let's imagine someone has a task.
 
 
00:19:31
 
Melissa McNeil: Mhm. Okay. Of course. It depends on the task because some are more important than others or some are part of an initiative or something like that. Usually you document your conversation whether it's a research note or a phone call you know note um and you know thoroughly explain why the person doesn't want to work on it. Um and then you can close the task. Um so some you don't want me to show you or you want me to What did you say? Sure. Okay. So I wouldn't do it from here. I go into the person's thing. Sure. So Oh, sorry. So, say um Jeff, who I just spoke to, um he didn't necessarily want to meet with a provider because he's very well connected to his provider. And generally, we encourage a provider visit anyway yearly. So, I'll revisit it again, but I did close it this time because we have talked about it a few times. So, um in the note, I would just explain all that.
 
 
00:21:21
 
Melissa McNeil: Um and then when you have a task, it's not on there anymore, but say you had a Okay, so say if he declined, I don't know, say if he declined, I don't even know what I would pick. Um Sure. So um in this not wrote declined APV at this time reporting he's very well connected to his primary care blah blah blah. So down here this one I also wrote up there about pathway as well and I updated Darcy the resource RN that he declined that pathway at this time because he's more focused on his hernia surgery. Um and we can re-review in the future. So ultimately you need to note that you discussed it, you know, you did your due diligence, you offered right and why he's declining and then you can
Efrain Calderon: So,
Melissa McNeil: close the task by completing it.
Efrain Calderon: gotcha. So, it sounds like, yeah, you you talked to the member, they said, "Hey, I'm not interested in doing this." You explain it in the note, and then you set the task, you attach the task to the um note that you're reporting on, and you set the task to complete.
 
 
00:22:31
 
Melissa McNeil: Yes.
Efrain Calderon: Okay?
Melissa McNeil: I think that for me, for my role, I think, you know, there's a few things that aren't driving or like, you know, lining up or things I might want to see. I think that other roles have different things. So there's just like compilation of stuff. There's a lot of stuff. Oh, okay. So I would give me the Oh, what is this? I would give me the option of this being shorter. I would change the Yeah. Yep. Or five, whatever. Um, due this week should be due this week. Um, not ongoing again as an option, I'm sure. Um, and then the regular check-in date isn't lining up, so I'm not going to use that. So, what I'm doing is taking more time, obviously, but it's making it right.
Efrain Calderon: when you say take more time because you're checking the dashboard, right?
Melissa McNeil: Well, I'm
Efrain Calderon: Or
Melissa McNeil: I'm
Efrain Calderon: is that what
Melissa McNeil: manually
Efrain Calderon: you mean?
 
 
00:24:13
 
Melissa McNeil: updating the dates instead of clicking one button. I'm
Efrain Calderon: I see. Okay.
Melissa McNeil: Right.
Efrain Calderon: Um, and then, you know, not to sound like an assessment question or anything that you deliver every day, but if you could say that these changes improve your workflow on a scale of 1 to five, um, where one, well, first I'd ask, would you say they improve your workflow, they haven't really changed your workflow or how you work, or they've made it harder? Um, which one of those would you say? Would you say it's made it easier, hasn't really changed it much, or has made it harder?
Melissa McNeil: It hasn't made it easier. It hasn't made it harder. Um, there are more things involved. So, the way I was working before for me, the way I work, I, you know, obviously everybody's different. um was more streamlined than what we're doing now, but it's not making it terrible. Like there are positive aspects to it. I like it. I love a to-do list.
 
 
00:25:16
 
Melissa McNeil: I like that option. Um you know what I mean? And it's not making it too much more time consuming. It's just a little bit. So Oh, it's okay. No,
Fabiana Simone: Yeah, I just have one more question and this has been super helpful to just learn from you Melissa and how it's been going. So, appreciate um appreciate the time. I'm curious to dig in a little bit more to understand, you know, let's say you're going to call Meline today and you go to the 360.
Melissa McNeil: Mhm.
Fabiana Simone: Um I'm curious how you're using the opportunity box. What does it tell you? And then what do you do with based on what you see here?
Melissa McNeil: So the pathways um the pathways are fairly newer in the sense of like we can offer usually we have a task so I go off of my tasks not necessarily the opportunities the um the pathways are more clinical to me. Um, so
Fabiana Simone: Mhm.
Melissa McNeil: not necessarily something that's a priority for me, but maybe the uh resource RN um I can offer it, but ultimately from there it would be passed on to her.
 
 
00:26:43
 
Fabiana Simone: Okay.
Melissa McNeil: Um, the breast cancer screening and the annual flu vaccine are tasks um that are missing for Meline um and opportunities to ask. So, I'll ask her, but that's I I generally focus on the um care plan tasks.
Fabiana Simone: Okay. And sorry, just to clarify, um, did you say you usually have a task accompanying these items in your inbox? Um,
Melissa McNeil: Yep.
Fabiana Simone: okay.
Melissa McNeil: Usually, it's
Fabiana Simone: Okay.
Melissa McNeil: attached as like an initiative, the flu vaccine um breast cancer screening um pathway offers. Um I don't know if those have changed since we started the pathway stuff, but
Fabiana Simone: Okay,
Melissa McNeil: um
Fabiana Simone: got it.
Melissa McNeil: yeah.
Fabiana Simone: Okay, so it sounds like the tasks are more guiding your work for these um or
Melissa McNeil: Yeah.
Fabiana Simone: is this box is it seems like it's just a little bit moreformational um for you?
Melissa McNeil: Yes. Yep.
Fabiana Simone: Okay, got it. Yeah, thank you. That's new. The opportunity box is new.
 
 
00:27:48
 
Fabiana Simone: So, I just
Melissa McNeil: Yeah.
Fabiana Simone: really want to understand if it is valuable for folks and how it's being used. So, I
Melissa McNeil: I
Fabiana Simone: appreciate
Melissa McNeil: feel like
Fabiana Simone: that.
Melissa McNeil: it's nice. The opportunity box is nice. I don't know if it needs to be here. I don't know
Fabiana Simone: Where would you put it if you had a magic wand?
Melissa McNeil: if I had a magic wand.
Fabiana Simone: Mhm.
Melissa McNeil: So, I would put these two. No, that one's fine. I would put this one. No, no, this one's just too much.
Fabiana Simone: Okay.
Melissa McNeil: I don't know. I don't know if I'd put it here, though. I don't know if it's the font. I don't know if it's just the format. I don't know what it is. It's just not It's just a lot going on,
Fabiana Simone: Okay.
Melissa McNeil: you know.
Fabiana Simone: Yeah. All right, thank you. That's only Additional info.
 
 
00:28:35
 
Fabiana Simone: I was looking for and it was really
Melissa McNeil: Sorry
Fabiana Simone: helpful here.
Melissa McNeil: if I wasn't
Fabiana Simone: Thank
Melissa McNeil: helpful.
Fabiana Simone: you. Now, that was very helpful.
Ryan Senning: I think just the your one of your last comments um in your summary, Melissa, was um you feel like it's it's it's making like it's it's taking a little more time than it used to.
Melissa McNeil: Mhm.
Ryan Senning: Are you are you um specifically naming the acuity check-ins and like the multiple calls for each check-in or is it more than that?
Melissa McNeil: I think that is what it is because I think a lot of obviously we all know numbers um are a big thing so they want people to make more of an effort that maybe weren't right um to outreach people and I get that um I think it's just the um the step the additional steps um I don't Oh, I forgot what I was going to say. I kind of blanked out. Sorry about that, Ryan. Um, oh my goodness gracious. Um,
 
 
00:29:40
 
Ryan Senning: So yeah, it's not it's extra steps to to make those additional calls.
Melissa McNeil: well, it's extra steps that No, it wasn't the cause necessarily. It's extra steps to doing the the the actual tasks, right? Like um going here and and there when before I was just going here, right? um checking to make sure the two attempts are done and the date line like before I just knew you know what I don't know I guess it's going to be good for a newer person coming in to learn this way um I already had it down before so it's just additional um steps but ultimately it's not negatively affecting my workday you know what I mean um I don't want to be negative in that way um because there are obviously positives to it right Um
Efrain Calderon: When when you said just now that like before you just knew um instead of having to check the thing the thing, can you tell me can you like think back to like um how you would know?
Melissa McNeil: that's that comes in time, right?
 
 
00:30:44
 
Melissa McNeil: Um just learning your job, right? Um, I have a certain work like how I flow my day and like that's just how I rolled and maybe everybody didn't nobody works the same way but um whatever I was doing was working for me. So, and I Oh, I love the zus button. I Yeah. So, I have I have a guy that has never answered the phone for anyone. I don't know why he's still on my case load, but anyway, I called today because he is literally due today for an H. So, one of my last attempts was looking in here obviously for more research, but I um this is just so easy and simple and wonderful. So, I had this number of course. Um, so then I attempted that number and I didn't have an email on file, so I shot him an email. Um, see if it was him. Um, you know, I love this. It's just easily accessible for me. I know that other people will need other information and like that's awesome, right?
 
 
00:32:07
 
Melissa McNeil: Like but this is pretty cool. Where are you? I haven't really had to use Zus a lot. I've only used it a couple of times. So, no. Should I press it?
Efrain Calderon: Um, no. I mean, I don't want I don't want to guide what you should do. I'm just I'm just curious. Um, well, if you want to press it, press it. Let's see. Let's see what happens. I don't
Melissa McNeil: If
Efrain Calderon: think
Melissa McNeil: it
Efrain Calderon: anything
Melissa McNeil: breaks,
Efrain Calderon: bad will
Melissa McNeil: it's
Efrain Calderon: happen.
Melissa McNeil: your fault.
Efrain Calderon: Okay, cool. I'll own that.
Melissa McNeil: Oh. Oh. Oh. Should I put in a reason? No. This I guess it would just update it as of today's date if there's any new information that was missing, right? Like a refresh of his page to see if there was anything new. I would hope it's instant. Um, as of today's date Well, I think that when you re Yeah.
 
 
00:33:36
 
Melissa McNeil: when you refresh a page, right, you
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: want it to be
Efrain Calderon: Yeah,
Melissa McNeil: up
Efrain Calderon: that
Melissa McNeil: to
Efrain Calderon: makes
Melissa McNeil: time,
Efrain Calderon: sense.
Melissa McNeil: right? So,
Efrain Calderon: Um, well, Melissa, I I do want to be cognizant of your time and everything. This is like such great feedback and I really appreciate you being
Melissa McNeil: I
Efrain Calderon: um
Melissa McNeil: appreciate
Efrain Calderon: candid
Melissa McNeil: your
Efrain Calderon: with us, not holding anything back and telling us how you work. Um, if anything else comes up and you have questions about something in common or whatever, first I would encourage you to post in that support channel too because you know people it gives people the ability to say like yeah, you know, I deal with that too. Maybe someone doesn't want to speak up but they're like I deal with this too.
Melissa McNeil: I did
Efrain Calderon: Um,
Melissa McNeil: um agree with a woman mentally I agreed with her and sent it to my pod pod chat and everybody was like I know.
 
 
00:34:22
 
Melissa McNeil: So, I know they're meeting today at 3:30, so we're adding some things to the list, but it was um Oh my goodness, where is she? She seems to be on it. Uh Cheryl Newberry 10:08.
Efrain Calderon: Yeah, I was talking to Cheryl too. So, it was a similar thing where she came to me with that feedback. I said, you know, I think that'd be valuable to post in the channel so that everyone could see it. And sure enough, other people were like, yeah, I also deal with this.
Melissa McNeil: I think it's hard in general doing your job right and for the person for the agency and the um you know toughs insurance and and our prov and our payer source and all that stuff and then having to deal with like the reality right of the population that we serve. So you want to get all these numbers and you want us to do all this work and I understand that aspect of it, management, all that stuff. I get it. But then I understand the other piece of it, right?
 
 
00:35:24
 
Melissa McNeil: Like these people do not some people love our our support and how we support them. Some people it's a little much sometimes. So especially if they're not medically doing well or mental mental health wise not doing well. Oh yeah. Yeah. And from different people and it's like,
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: "Oh, I feel bad."
Efrain Calderon: Yeah.
Melissa McNeil: But
Efrain Calderon: Well, you know,
Melissa McNeil: it
Efrain Calderon: the only way we we can make it better is by knowing it. And I totally I totally hear that. Appreciate the honesty. And
Melissa McNeil: absolutely
Efrain Calderon: um yeah, feel free to reach out if you have any other questions about common stuff or, you know, whatever. If there's something that you're like, I want to post this in support, but like whatever, you
Melissa McNeil: Sure.
Efrain Calderon: can reach out to me, but I'll probably be like, "Come on, post in support."
Melissa McNeil: I
Efrain Calderon: Um
Melissa McNeil: don't mind posting it.
Efrain Calderon: yeah. Yeah, that's good. Um
Melissa McNeil: I appreciate it.
Efrain Calderon: all right. Have a good rest of your day. Thanks so much for
Melissa McNeil: You
Efrain Calderon: your help.
Melissa McNeil: guys have a good one. Bye.
Efrain Calderon: All right.
