Ways of Working: Feedback

| Feedback | Next Steps | Market |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Core Assessment RNs do not think the Core Assessment is helpful. CHPs do think the Core Assessment provides helpful information. RNs would prefer info about living alone, ADLs, special needs like glasses, etc. Nurses capture this important info in the “360” (is this an assessment?) Wording of the core assessment could be adjusted. The “Why do you feel that way” questions sometimes feel inappropriate. Core → care plan development can feel challenging. Core does not always help CHPs care plan  | Raise to core assessment owners | IN |
| Track Change Presented in case conference to consider a track change Its more work to change the track.  If the member needs to be called less frequently, we may not change the track but just skip RCI calls.  “Its a battle to get the track changed” Accusation that RN requests track change so they are not the primary. This is not the case. They’re happy to remain primary but don’t need to be calling the member as frequently.  CHP will ask member what their preference is for contact. Some members prefer more frequent contact because its helpful even if not necessary.  Everyone who’s diabetic is intensive. This does not feel necessary for all diabetic members. It would be beneficial to use acuity for contact frequency. | Need to take another look at the track change process to make it ***easy*** |  |
| Find Help This information is not up to date and gives incorrect information about hours of operations email/text from findhelp to members are not going through. Need to ensure there is a clear escalation process for Find Help CHPs dont always have the time to solve these issues as one-offs, they need help to enable systemic change, Refresher training needed on how to escalate find help | Shoshana to own this |  |
| Refresher training would be beneficial on how/when to use the referral pill in Commons | Refresher slides added [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KInIFkk9NuIMiTMk-NGbd8TNZiXozQnrSTDOjKbe0z0/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g635a3e763bcb46f1_0) |  |
| Healthy living goals (ex: exercise)  have been removed from goal library, however, those had been useful for care teams  |  |  |
| If you forget to use the template for your note (regular check-in), and you go back and edit your note, the template doesn’t “count” Need to ensure if teams use multiple templates for an interaction, that both templates count (ex: if urgent social needs escalation, use that template, then if you turn the call into a regular check-in, also use that template. Both should count as used | Raise to product  |  |
| ~~When a member completes TOC, we don’t want the regular check-in date overdue. DELIVERED 3/16~~  | ~~Raise to product. Should b e due 7/14 days after, then handoff call wouldn’t be needed~~ |  |
| Difficult to reach letters are sent in IN even if many unsuccessful calls are made, then users are expected to continue to call | Incorporate into new formal process |  |
| Would be helpful to have last attempt date in the regular check-in folder as well | Raise to design |  |
| Can we consider bringing back the accordion fields from the member feed (last outreach, tasks open, etc.) This was used frequently by RNs | Revisit |  |
| Opportunity widget Greater than or less than sign is confusing  |  |  |
| Slack message along with creating any urgent priority task, as a courtesy \- if assigned to someone else |  |  |
| Tasking guidance communicated to central teams \- CTC, MIC, OS, etc.  OSs are unnecessarily escalating “urgent needs” that are not truly urgent.  |  |  |
| ~~There is no real coverage plan / process for CHPs~~ |  |  |
| There are a lot of different  templates with similar info, everyone uses something different (ex: welcome visit template, initial assessment template, 360). Variation within the teams. Also quality of documentation is sometimes very poor / challenging for the next person to take next steps | Incorporate into QA process? | IN |
| **MA P32** Do our ICT meetings with the member count towards regular check-ins? We cover the same things as we do in a regular check-in PLUS additional items | Raise to MA leadership for consideration |  |
| **Indy** |  |  |
| Can you share MIC operation overview \- VUC vs ED@H, escalation process, etc.  |  |  |
| Goal templates that are missing:  Adherence template Engagement template Healthy living template |  |  |
| More clarity / support needed around TOC \<\> LCT coordination. What happens to open work / new tasks assigned. CHPs report needing to slack the TOC RNs to figure out a game plan, 50% of the time the CHP should proceed with the task |  |  |
| 80% successful RCIs will be impossible targets to hit for BH CHPs who have much smaller panels |  |  |
| it would be helpful to explore a way to move existing task due dates to RCI in bulk in the future (similar to how you can now bulk reassign tasks to primary). Otherwise, the process of moving a large volume of tasks to RCI is time consuming | Explore as future improvement | IN |
| We should encourage scheduling regular check-ins to increase the likelihood of member answering the phone, unlocks automated SMS reminders, etc.  | Revisit for national launch, raise to Kyle for capacity planning |  |
| Inbox: Regular Check-in Folder: My care team \- add Primary to the row or the ability to filter by Primary so managers and leads can help manage users who are out sick. Requested separately by 3 people.  |  |  |
