**Goal**  
The goal of this meeting is to align and ensure a shared understanding of the two bodies of work.

**Exercise**

|  | Intelligent Prioritization  | Loop Closure |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Current projects and detailed features being worked on | New Inbox changes: Remove unused inboxes Urgent Following Mentions Initiatives Completed Add new ones: Due today Due this week Regular check-ins Member 360 changes: Remove unused widgets Teams Acuity Workflows Meds Elevate **Quality** Opportunities Add tasks to 360 view Add TOC/MIC to 360 view Create Track/Acuity switch for P32H Add most recent appointment Separate Programs/Pathways eligibility from enrollment in UI (move to Opportunities widget) | Additions to 360 page: Regular check-in widget Shows due date Shows number of attempts Changes to tasks: New due date type: Regular check-in.  Object-level view of tasks 360 page Care plan Task detail view after clicking task Edit task view Archiving tasks Providing a reason for archiving Recurring (repeat) tasks if RCI associated Logic/backend changes: Move Mass/P32H to Regular check-ins Tie regular check-in success/attempt to Note template Count number of unsuccessful attempts. Adjust regular check in according to logic (number of unsuccessful or successful attempts) |
| Future projects/features | Deprecate based on usage & feedback: Home \- To-do list Home \- Member feed Inbox \- To-do list Google calendar connection Smaller features: Floating note UI Core assessment question widget Add IOS to member feed (blocked) Larger features: Manager/supervisor view (unknown) What are we doing with Diagnosis Opportunities? (BOI) Are we going to iterate on Loop closure for Opportunities? | Fast follow work: Allowing goal templates or task templates to use regular check-in as due date More discussion needed: Additional repeat cadences Task categories Ways to reduce documentation burden when logging a successful or unsuccessful regular check-in attempt Longer term Thinking about whether things that are not tasks now, like Quality Opportunities, would be better as tasks. |
| Open questions/challenges  | IMO we are launching too much too fast. This creates a few problems:Hard to test all of the features all at once to evaluate for success/failure Impossible to iterate based on feedback Hard to design for when so many things are in flux Hard to keep track of all of the ideas that have been cut for MVP | Need to figure out what level of ‘attaching’ function to timeline notes we need/don’t need  Skeptical of the value of repeating tasks or other features that reduce user control like enforcing due date ranges per-priority level. “Loop closure” can mean anything to anyone. A loop is work \- and work can vary by primitive, team, service, etc.  We’re relying a lot on training to inform users \- probably because a lot of what we’re building is not intuitive. We have long manual note templates \- are these contributing to documentation burden and not delivering value since it’s not structured data? HMW reduce? |
| Q: Neves/Rachel | \[NR\] Would these products launch together or separately? \[RB\] Jesse you mentioned IOS and regular check in in conflict, stalling IOS implementation–can you say more? \[RB\] Floating note | \[NR\] What does the 3-6 month forward looking roadmap looks like for the Loop Closure team  |

* Is the work achieving what leadership was seeking out?  
* How is the actual product development process going? Can you do one successfully without the other? Could you do an iterative release? Or Waterfall?  
* It doesn’t seem we’re not really solving IP or LC and the process has been waterfall and slow and come 3/3 \- it’ll likely be a tough launch because of the change mgmt.   
* Even if we’re not solving IP or LC we’re getting good redesign/value and improving the UX anyway.
