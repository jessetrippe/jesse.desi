Foundational Training

Each member is assigned a Primary Contact dependent on the Member’s more frequent needs whether social or clinical in nature as well as according to the Core Services Track (Intensive, Focused, Responsive)
Minimum Outreach: Cadence determined by Core Services Track
Proactive Outreach: Cadence determined by Care Plan & Care Pathways
Care plan goals, which are co-created by the care team and the member should drive the connection cadence with a member to stay on track to accomplish the goal.
When members are either succeeding at their care plan or falling behind on accomplishing their goals, the check-in is designed to resurface members for outreach by the care team to connect and re-engage the member. This could be an opportunity to re-evaluate the member’s assigned track, as well. 
What Drives Member Engagement?

Primary is responsible for:

CHPs can support RNCMs with:

Health Related Social Needs (housing, transportation, utility support, food insecurity, cell phone assistance)
Supporting Care Pathways
Navigating to services for closing quality opportunities: provider visit, lab check, cancer screening
RNCMs can support CHPs with:


Member clinical concerns
Clinical Home Visits
Condition-specific Care Pathways
Assistance with clinical care planning
Counseling on clinical aspects of quality opportunities
Ensuring CORE assessment is completed and initial care plan is created
Member’s chart updates (demographics, care team)
Check in call attempts at set cadence
Care plan updates
Presentation and documentation of case conference
ED discharge outreaches (can be determined to be delegated to clinical staff as needed)
MIC follow ups (can be determined to be delegated to clinical staff as needed)
Monitoring progress towards / taking action on quality opportunities
Longitudinal Care: RN/CHP Dyad
RNCMs have tasking to follow up on answers from CORE assessment to drive care planning

Longitudinal Care: Track Management
Member track is not a permanent assignment. Care team members have the ability to request track changes for members to either increase or decrease their track based on need. 
Examples of why a track change may be suggested:
Tracks may be increased if:
Member would benefit from more frequent check-ins
Member has uncontrolled clinical or social needs Cityblock should manage (e.g., for care pathway enrollment)
Member is disengaged from or distrusts community providers
Tracks may be decreased if:
Member’s health and social conditions are well controlled (e.g., graduated from care pathway)
Member requests less frequent contact
Member’s needs are sufficiently met by community providers


Submitting a Track Change Suggestion
Any care team member may submit a track change suggestion at any time by completing the “Member Track Change Request Tool” in Commons.

To complete the tool:
Navigate to the member’s timeline in Commons
Select “Actions” in the bottom right of the left-hand panel
Select “Administer a tool”
Search for “Member Track” and select the “Member Track Change Request Tool”


Longitudinal Care: Member Escalation to MIC
Hours of Operation
24/7/365 in all markets
Clinical Scope
Urgent Care - Clinical Scope    &    When to Contact Urgent Care - Quick Guide
How to Initiate
Have member call or Staff can warm transfer to:  833-904-2273 (CARE) (Clinical staff can meet with VUC prior to member interaction)
Documentation & Handoff
Provider will document in EHR.  Provider will also fill out an “Acute Care Encounter Log” tool in Commons, which adds a task to the follow-up queue.  [Source: SOP: Handoffs]
When connecting with members, urgent needs may arise. Members may report that they are feeling unwell, have an injury, or need mental health support. When urgent needs arise, we utilize our MIC team to support the member. 
Virtual Urgent Care: On-demand telephone and video visits with an APP for urgent clinical needs. 

ED at Home: About 20% of the time, Urgent Care visits escalate to an “ED at Home”, where the MIC APP dispatches  an Advanced Community Care Clinician (paramedic) to visit the member in person while APP directs the visit via video.
Virtual Escalations Procedure
Inform the member that you are going to escalate their concern to our provider team and put them on hold
Call 833-904-2273 (Central Escalation Line)
The virtual escalations team can do further clinical triage to determine what appropriate clinical intervention will be needed.
Stay on the call while member is triaged
Virtual escalations team will update the pod provider and provider of the day of the next steps and needed support. 


Longitudinal Care: Supporting Health Related Social Needs 


Step 1: 
Identify Need
There are many ways to identify a need: 

Structured Assessments 
Regular check-ins or contact with members

Needs should always be documented in notes or through an assessment. 
Step 2: 
Find Resources
Researching resources and determining eligibility is critical to ensuring we are appropriately addressing member needs. 

The first step should always be to evaluate if the member’s plan offers a benefit that will meet their need. After that, it’s time to use community based organizations (CBOs). At Cityblock, we use FindHelp, which can be accessed through Okta. 
Step 3: 
Make Referral
Once you have decided on which resources best meet the member’s needs: 

Discuss resources with the member
Make the referral
Update the Care Plan to reflect your work

Step 5:
Follow-up with Member 
Make sure the member got what they needed. 

Was the CBO successful in meeting the member’s needs?

If not, refer back to step 2 and research other CBO’s within scope and make appropriate recommendations referral


Step 4: 
Document Referral
Always document your referrals using the “pill” in Commons (learn more here). 

⭐️Note: We’ve updated the fields in the referral modal to better understand the WHY and WHERE  behind our referrals

If appropriate, document referral in Find Help.

Refresher: How to document external referrals in Commons
Start a timeline note
Click the referral pill
Fill out the referral type, organization name & reason for referral

Food Access
Read through housing and food insecurity template goals here.
NEW! Housing & Food Access Goal Templates
To better address and track our members' social needs, we've created new Housing and Food Access goal templates. These templates are designed to help us more accurately capture the work we're doing to support members in these critical areas.
How to use:
Go to the Care Plan 
Select “Add Goal”in the top right corner 
Once you select a goal template, the "Review Tasks" button will activate and turn blue, allowing you to choose specific tasks related to the corresponding goal
If the "Review Tasks" button is not clickable,  that means no goal template has been selected.


 💥 Hot Tips!
You can add as many goals as needed based on the member’s unique circumstances.
Be sure to update the goals to reflect the member’s specific needs for a more tailored and personalized member care approach.
Housing

We deploy in-home, virtual, or community- based primary care, as needed, to extend the reach of external Primary Care Providers (PCPs),  close quality gaps, enhance access, or enable care transitions. 
Wrap Services means we are not the designated PCP, but a safety net provider that can supplement external PCP care. 

Key Offerings:
Wrap Care Coordination for external providers: Cityblock’s clinical and non-clinical services seamlessly augment and support existing PCP external relationships.
PCP Assigned: Cityblock can be the attributed PCP for members. The care team wraps around our own internal CBH PCP providers.

Longitudinal Care: Trust and Satisfaction
Cityblock’s mission is to radically improve the health of marginalized communities
We believe that we can only achieve this if we have the trust of our members. This is why Cityblock has developed a Trust Checklist that should be used with each meaningful interaction with our members. This helps us build trust and begins a relationship that will strengthen member engagement along the member’s health journey. The checklist includes four important elements that drive trust and satisfaction…

Bundling Guidance
🎯 On-time Task Completion Rate
🎯 Tasks Completed/Day
🎯 Decrease % of open quality gaps
Reaching a member can be challenging, we want to make the most of their time once they are engaged. 
Bundling work is good for members. Members get fewer calls from us, but each one is more meaningful and comprehensive. We deliver more value to the member in every interaction. Also, bundling helps us reduce transfers between care team members to create a smoother, less confusing member experience.
Bundling work helps make things easier and more efficient for care team members. Teams will go from conducting multiple outreaches per member to bundling more outreach efforts around one regular check-in (for tasks involving outreach).
What is the value of bundling?
C

Before an interaction, identify open opportunities (360 page) &  tasks (care plan) you can try to address with the member
Reduce transfers! Each role has their own area of expertise but many activities can be supported by multiple roles, such as:
Managing competing priorities & concerns
Care coordination, such as arranging transportation
Scheduling a provider visit for a focused need (ex. quality opportunity) 
Helping to prepare a member for a provider visit
Referring to behavioral health
Screening health related social needs
Help your teammates out! 
RNCMs can help make progress on tasks assigned to CHPs (ex: assist with transportation, check in on housing application). 
CHPs can’t close clinical tasks, but can help make progress on tasks assigned to RNCMs (ex: schedule clinical visit, remind member of upcoming visit)
Always try to cover as much as you can, unless the visit is getting too long and/or the member is fatigued 
✅ We should… Always identify what else you can make progress on & bundle into a successful member interaction
❌ Instead of… 3 open tasks for a member, each with a different due date, possibly resulting in 3 different interactions

Care Team Panels
As a CHP/RN/MCN, you are responsible for Activated Members engaged with Cityblock. Every outreach attempt you make to a Member who we can reasonably predict will not answer the call, we are trading off an opportunity engagement with a Member who will answer and actively partner in improving their health.
Reviews for Disengagement
Multiple unsuccessful Regular Check-ins prompts a CTL review of the Member profile to consider reassignment to a Reengagement Specialist
Commons Empanelment
Smart empanelment tooling in Commons to ensure only Activated and earnestly engaged Members are on a CHP/RN/MCN’s panel.

Panel Management & Member Prioritization

Our goal is to meet the member where they are - to understand their needs and work with them to build a plan around their needs. To do that, we need to keep members engaged (regular check-in) and have a way to track our progress toward the member’s goals (tasks)
Helps us focus on the right member at the right time
Helps us to coordinate our contact with the Member across our care team (aka who is doing what)
Organizes us so we can “do what we said we’d do”. When we tell a Member we will call them every 30/60/90 days, it’s critical we fulfill that promise. The same goes for a call to resolve a specific member need.

Regular Check-Ins “On Hold”
Attempts on Time: 🎯 100%
Successful Regular Check-Ins:  🎯 80%
When a Member has an open TOC Workflow or is pending disenrollment, their Regular Check-In is “on hold” 
📈 While the Regular Check-in is                                      it will remain in your folder but does not impact your performance metrics.
⚙️ When the TOC workflow is closed, the RCI due date will automatically change to +14 days from workflow end date. 
Note: RCI dates are set to 14 days after a TOC workflow is closed in all situations (whether the RCI due date was during the TOC period or was initially in the future).
How it works:

Skip or Delay Regular Check-Ins
Attempts on Time: 🎯 100%
Successful Regular Check-Ins:  🎯 80%
Some Regular Check-In attempts are neither successful nor unsuccessful. When there is a need to delay or skip a regular check-in, use these templates to complete your documentation. 
❌  Skip Regular Check-In
Use this when it’s appropriate to fully skip the next RCI. Some examples of this may include:
Member requests to skip this RCI
Member is traveling or on extended leave
Member is in a SNF and we’re not actively following
⚙️ Automatically updates the RCI due date based on cadence (30/60/90 days from the date of use). 
📈This will count as an on-time attempt. 
🔜  Delay Regular Check-In
Use this when a member does want to check in, just not right now. 
⚙️This template postpones the due date by 7 days (to extend the time you have to complete an on-time and successful Regular Check-in).
📈Usage of this template will not count toward successful or unsuccessful attempts - reporting will measure based on the  updated due date.
Note: This template is intended for one-time use - track changes may be more appropriate if this is needed repeatedly for a member

Make outreach attempts on different days / different times of day
✅
Mix modalities. For example, send a text the day before you call
✅
Call different available phone numbers, including emergency contacts
✅
Schedule your next contact with a Member, before you hang up the phone
✅
Look for numbers the Member used to text/call inbound
❌
Do not call the same number back-to-back on the same day

Regular Check-In and Comprehensive Interactions

After identifying which member you should focus on first using your inbox (whether prompted by regular check-in or a task), review the following to help inform your upcoming interaction:

The member’s 360 page for a snapshot and to understand all open opportunities for the member which you can try to address
The member’s care plan to understand member goals and all open tasks which you can attempt to make progress on

3+ open Diagnosis Opportunities
No provider visit* scheduled
No provider visit* completed this year

Then offer the member a Clinical Intake or Annual Provider Visit 

Member has NEVER seen a Cityblock provider*: Clinical Intake
Member has previously seen a Cityblock provider*, but not this year: Annual Provider Visit

💡 For additional guidance, refer to the recent CHP/RN quality training 
Diagnosis Opportunities

Target MIC User Flag and Call to Action
Who are Target MIC Users?
Members who have the highest likelihood to have a MIC-preventable ED or IP visit in the next 6 months
In other words, they are the members we want to target to use MIC Urgent Care, to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations 
Action Needed:
Longitudinal Teams
Ensure MIC Urgent Care is always top of mind: 
When prepping for any member interaction, review the member 360 page and look for the new "Target MIC User” flag
If a member has this flag, discuss benefits of MIC Urgent Care with the member, referencing the MIC Urgent Care Script for support
Action Needed
Why is this important? 
MIC Urgent Care is one of Cityblock’s largest levers to reducing unnecessary hospital visits and total cost of care. Live reminders by care team members (i.e. RNCMs and CHPs) are proven to be the most effective way to promote use of this service to potentially avoid an ED/IP visit, and get members the right care at the right time.



☑️ Review your panel (Task & Regular Check-In folders in your Inbox)

Regular Check-In

💡Share your thoughts!
Why do we do regular check-ins? Why are check-ins important?

Regular Check-In

Our mission is to radically improve the health of marginalized communities at scale. Each check-in is a step towards that - we meet the member where they are by affirming their greatest concerns, making progress on open needs raised by the member or Cityblock, and set next steps and expectations on when the next interaction with the member will be.
Proactive care (closing quality gaps) allows us to support our members in staying healthy
Keeping members engaged in Cityblock services (regular check-in) allows us to reliably be there for members in the moments that matter - if they need help, if things change, and on their overall journey to stay and be healthy.

Cityblock Tasking Guidelines
🎯 On-time Task Completion Rate
🎯 Tasks Completed/Day
TASKING GUIDELINES
✅
Tasks should represent discrete action items 
Tasks should not be used for FYIs or for visibility 
✅
Tasks must always have an appropriate assigned owner
If a task is unassigned in a queue, it must be reviewed & assigned within 1 business day
✅
Tasks must always have a due date 
Due dates should always be appropriate for priority level (see here)
✅
Task priority level must be appropriate (see here)
✅
Tasks should be tied to associated care plan goals when applicable
❌
Task due dates should not be moved except for in specific scenarios 
If you put a task on hold because you are temporarily blocked, you can move the due date to when you will attempt to resume the work again
If you need to outreach a member to complete a specific task but you’re unable to reach them after 3x attempts, you can move the due date to when you will try again later 

Task Priority Levels
Urgent
1 business day 

Clinical follow-ups needed
Medication / pharmacy requests
Same day visit rescheduling or visit transportation needs
External provider follow-ups
Important
2-5 business days
Self-activation 
Program workflows
Some inbound comms. workflows (assisting members with DME needs, assisting with nutritional resources, following up on general CBH interest)

Setting task due date to Regular Check-In
You can now easily set task due dates to the member’s next regular check-in a single click. 
🎯 On-time Task Completion Rate
🎯 Tasks Completed/Day
✨Bundle work✨ by organizing tasks around the member’s regular check-in
Simplify your panel management. Tasks due at regular check-in will be hidden from your inbox task folders (less clutter & more focus!)
Fewer clicks. Task due date will always update to match the member’s next regular check-in date until the task is completed or archived
This feature only works for activated members 
Additional Details
Have you ever…
Felt like you were selecting an arbitrary / “fake” due date for a task?
Felt unsure of what due date to set for a task?
Found yourself counting +30/60/90 days for a due date to align with a member’s next RCI?
Felt overwhelmed with having many tasks open for a member, each with a different due date?

Setting task due date to Regular Check-In
🎯 On-time Task Completion Rate
🎯 Tasks Completed/Day
🚨 Not all tasks should be due at the next regular check-in
If a task is…
For example…
Then set the due date to…
Normal priority and you believe it can be addressed in 30/60/90 days (depends on track), as part of the member’s regular check-in
Interventions
Care pathway tasks
Non-urgent care management tasks
Quality opportunity tasks
Due at regular check-In

✅ Use new feature!
Urgent, important or normal priority and should not wait up to 30/60/90 days to be completed
Medication / pharmacy requests
Follow-ups for inbound communications
Care management follow-ups that need to be completed before you call the member to discuss
To sometime before the regular check-in (set due date appropriate for priority level)

❌ Do not use new feature to set due date to regular check-in
💡If you are unable to reach the member to complete a task after making 3 attempts, you can set the task to due at regular check-in & try again later (if appropriate) or archive the task (if not appropriate to keep trying)
Pause to confirm task clean up / review of normal priority tasks 

Task Statuses

Task Status
Meaning
When to Use
I haven’t started the thing
If you have not started to work on the task
I am working on the thing
If you started to work on the task but there is additional work to be completed
I can’t do the thing right now OR it’s not appropriate to do the thing right now; I'm temporarily blocked
If you cannot complete the task at this time because you are temporarily blocked, but the work should be resumed in the future. Tasks can be put on hold for the following reasons:
Member is working with another team (ex: TOC) and it would not be appropriate to address task at this time
Member is away for an extended period of time, but is expected to return to CBH care
Member is pending disenrollment

⚠️  If a task is put on hold, the task due date should be moved to when you will attempt to resume the work (ex: at the next regular check-in or sooner if important/ urgent)

If you have completed all work associated with this task
I attempted to do the thing, but I couldn’t complete it.
If you cannot complete the task for the following reasons: 
Member could not be reached for this specific task
Member declined assistance/refused this task
Member is permanent resident of long term care facility

Member opts out of Cityblock services
Member opts out of all interactions and contact from Cityblock
Member is deceased
Member is no longer insured/disenrolled from plan

❌ Users should only delete tasks if the task was created in error or if the task is a duplicate 
🎯 On-time Task Completion Rate
🎯 Tasks Completed/Day

Archive tasks instead of falsely completing tasks, letting tasks sit as overdue, or deleting tasks 
Remember, if you can’t reach a member to complete a specific task (3x attempts required), either:	
Push the task to the member’s regular check-in & try again later 
Archive the task if it would not make sense to try again at the member's regular check in (ex: if task was related to an upcoming appointment that would no longer be relevant by then)
Complete any other required documentation in Commons 
Timeline notes (ex: “tried to schedule member for provider visit but member refused”)
Member preferences (ex: if member opts out of CBH services or contact from CBH, or if member is deceased)
If you attempted to complete a task, but couldn’t complete it for reasons beyond your control, you can now archive the task to show “I tried to do the thing, but I couldn’t and here’s why”
Archiving Tasks
🎯 On-time Task Completion Rate
🎯 Tasks Completed/Day
Additional Details

Set a task date to regular check-in
Set task to repeat at each regular check-in 
Once completed, a new task will be automatically created & due at the next regular check-in. You no longer have to manually duplicate tasks! 
If a task is set to repeat at each regular check-in but you want this to stop, edit the task & adjust the repeat task setting to “no.” If the task was auto-generated in error, you can delete the task
Examples of tasks that could be repeated at every regular check-in:
Providing edu. on condition management  
Completing med recs 
Ordering & uploading labs
Reviewing symptom action plans 
Checking in on housing or food needs
Tasking | Repeating Tasks
If you set a task due date to regular check-in, you now have the option to repeat that task at each regular check-in. This means, once the task is completed, it will automatically generate the exact same task for you!
How it works

Standard task guidelines enable Campaigns to surfaced as tasks
Campaigns are an integration of many modes of outreach (Marketing, EngOps, Care Teams) that enable us to deliver personalized, high-touch messages to members based on their specific needs

With campaigns, we integrate our engagement tactics to build a more seamless flow of communication from various parts of CBH - reassuring members that the messaging they're receiving from Marketing is connected to the relationship they've built with you, a trusted care team member
From

Chase Lists
To

✨Tasks in your Panel ✨
Combing through a chase list to determine which members are included as part of a campaign
Manually tracking the outcome of each campaign outreach attempt on a separate spreadsheet
Credit for campaign outreach only attributed when a successful connection was completed along with an associated research note
Automatically surfaced in Commons Inbox and Care Plan
Automatic outcome tracking of each campaign outreach attempt by utilizing task statuses
Credit will automatically be received for campaign outreach connections as part of the revised performance mgmt
🎯 On-time Task Completion Rate
🎯 Tasks Completed/Day
Care teams will be informed about upcoming campaign outreach by their ops director or CTM
Campaign Background:
This revamp of tasking will enable us to begin to move activities into your panel that have historically been done as a ‘side of your desk’ item outside of Commons (with many pain points)
This is a spotlight of a soon-to-be example of an input to your new Commons surface → outreach campaigns
Been an increasing push to utilize more campaigns in 2025 (streamlined integration of Marketing, EngOps, and Care Team outreach)
Allow us to deliver personalized, high-touch messages to members based on their specific needs
The role that you (care teams) play → connecting the messaging they’re receiving from Marketing (SMS, email, etc) to the relationship they’ve built with you as their trusted care team member)
From Chase Lists to Tasks in Your Panel:
As many of you likely know - campaigns are now largely being being surfaced to you via spreadsheet chase lists
Results in a lot of tedious work → taking you out of Commons to see which members are included in a campaign and needing to track the campaign follow-up in a separate spreadsheet
Campaigns will now soon be surfaced as tasks in your panel
Will no longer require you to reference a separate ‘side of the desk’ spreadsheet
You will be able to see which members are included in a campaign via Inbox and Care Plan
Outreach outcomes will be tracked automatically via selection of the campaign task status
Credit will automatically be received for campaign outreach connections and attempts → to be discussed more in perf mgmt section next
Stay tuned for communication coming shortly regarding campaigns from your Ops Directors or CTMs → you should begin to see campaigns surfaced through your panel in the coming weeks and months as we work to continue to build out the infrastructure with the MX team

WoW “Lite” Training (Async)
Inbox, 360, Bundling

Commons Update | Inbox & 360 Page
What’s new? 

⭐️ The Inbox has new folders to organize tasks “due today” and “due this week”
⭐️ The 360 page is refreshed to better focus your attention on important Member opportunities, a summary of the Member’s health, and their recent and upcoming interactions with Cityblock. 
⭐️ A focus on bundling work (Tasks, Quality gaps, BOI gaps, Pathway/Program enrollment) to improve Cityblock efficiency and Member experience. 
Why the change?

We heard you! Frequent Cityblock frontline team member feedback includes: 
It’s difficult to know which Member I should prioritize.
It’s unclear what I should focus on during my time with the Member.
I am overwhelmed when I view my Inbox.

For LTC Members, these folders exclude tasks due on the same day as the next Regular Check-In. 
Commons Inbox | Folders
Due today: A list of tasks assigned to you & due today. 
Due this week: A list of tasks assigned to you & due in the next 7 days. 
Regular check-ins (LTC ONLY) - Due dates and call attempt tracking for CHP, RNCM, and MCN led Regular Check-In activities
To-Do: User-created list of tasks.
My tasks: List of all tasks assigned to you
Inbox Folders pre-filter your “My Tasks” list to guide prioritization of the right work at the right time.

Bundling 
⭐️Reaching Members is one of Cityblock’s key challenges. When you do reach a member, complete as many tasks, actions on Quality/BOI gaps, and program/pathway enrollments as possible.

Note: You should only address work that is relevant to your role/license. Work assigned to speciality teams (BH, Pregnancy, etc.) should only be completed by those teams. 

⭐️ Bundling work is good for members as it means members get fewer calls from us, but each one is more meaningful and comprehensive.

⭐️ Bundling work helps make things easier and more efficient for care team members. Teams will go from conducting multiple outreaches per member to bundling multiple tasks/opportunities/work into a fewer interactions with the Member.

Core Assessment 
Core Assessment: A set of questions designed to identify the individual Member's health priorities within their physical, behavioral and social life domains.
The principles behind the Core Assessment are:
Don’t ask Members things we can look up ourselves. 
Assess member for match to CBH services/programs
Provide for both free text and structured (reportable) answer options
Assess for member value:
Quick value from us
Long term value for member health
Assess for quality of outside provider connections
Understand member priorities. 
Push more detailed assessment questions until further into therapeutic relationship with member

Guardianship and “Activated HCP”
Capacity
A person’s ability to make an informed decision about a particular situation/question

This can be situation-dependent
Providers can evaluate capacity, and may defer to a member’s HCP for particular decisions only
Competency
Guardianship
The mental capacity to make a decision or perform a certain act

Incompetence is a legal designation and decided by a court
When a person is deemed incompetent, a court can name a guardian to make decisions on their behalf

Can be full (for all aspects of a member’s life) or limited to only aspects of the member’s life outlined by the court

A guardian should always be offered the opportunity to be present during member interactions and be informed of interactions.
“Activated HCP (health care proxy)” is a designation often used by facilities when capacity cannot be evaluated in an ongoing way, but this person has not been deemed incompetent by a court.

Is individualized: based on each member’s unique needs, provides choice, and encompass conditions, concerns, abilities, routines, needs, wants and goals;
Is goal-oriented: Care Plans should always be person-centered, and highlight where the member is today and where they want to be or want to accomplish; 
Reflects tasks for care team members as well as member self-management tasks
Includes referrals to internal and external resources 
Is updated routinely by the care team and is consistent with members’ progress or lack thereof
Helps tell each member’s story and reflects the partnership between the care team and the member  
A Good Care Plan..

The Care Plan must be initiated within 14 days of assessment completion
Required: Each Care Plan must have at least 2 goals 
Goals should be based on what is uncovered in the CORE Assessment
For corresponding actions to the questions on the CORE, see here.
Recommended: 1 goal should be the preventative health goal
Goals must be in the SMART format
Ensure to identify and describe barriers to meeting goals 
Add tasks/steps to meet the goals
Required: Include at least 1 task assigned to the member for self management 
Add goal due date
Update as circumstances change and tasks and goals are completed 
Care Plan and Goal Guidelines and Requirements

Creating SMART Goals for the Care Plan
Cityblock uses SMART goals for both long (>90 days) and short term goals (<90 days)
Specific: Details of what you want to accomplish; the more specific, the easier it is to implement
Measurable: Allow you to track progress
Attainable/Achievable: Coach members to set achievable goals; break goals into small steps
Realistic/Relevant: Is it important to the member? What impact will it have?
Time-bound: Ground the goal with a deadline
Example: Member expressed food insecurity, difficulty managing chronic health conditions, including hypertension and diabetes.

SMART Goal - Short term:  Member will increase food accessibility by completing a referral to food resources in the community within the next month. 

SMART Goal - Long term: Member will increase food accessibility by applying and submitting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit (formerly known as food stamps) application by [date]

Goals are developed based on results from the core assessment and member interactions
Goals are centered around the member’s own priorities
Goals are guided by the domains of need identified
How are Goals Determined?

Care Planning for Housing and Food Insecurity
MSP (Medical Savings Plan) Target / KPI Scorecard: # of Completed goals for Food and Housing
To meet the requirements in the MSP and best demonstrate the work we are doing to members meet their goals, we recommend using a combination of short term (< 3 months) and long term (> 3 months) goals on the care plan. Use the templated goals in the goal library in Commons to demonstrate your work.

Quality: Commons Companion 
We can use the Quality Commons Companion as a tool that will allow Athena users to see a member’s open quality gaps during a visit, without having to go into Commons. We have done an extensive cleanup of the system, eradicating outdated and irrelevant gaps.
Only contracted, core, and OKR measures will surface now
Gaps are derived from Able, our certified HEDIS engine, which takes into account both internal and external services rendered 
Any actions taken in Athena will be synced to/reflected in Commons and vice versa to ensure full team collaboration 
If the corresponding action is not completed/documented appropriately in the chart, the gap will remain open. 

If the corresponding action IS completed/documented appropriately in the chart, that information will flow to Able, which will process that data and compute the gap as closed, pushing out the new “closed” status to the UI. Allow 48 hours for this refresh to occur. 
Note: Statuses updated in the Quality Commons Companion tool are primarily a checklist & reminder function that allows for visibility across the care team.
