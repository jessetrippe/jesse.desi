Solving @ Scale: Where We Are Today
We are in Step 5: Test & Build 
Today, we will focus on the MVP deployment plan.
In order to deploy the MVP, we are proposing that this group reviews the pilot and implementation plan as part of Deployment Approval.
Approval Request: Does the implementation and training plan include all the components necessary to launch the MVP in markets? Does the pilot plan adequately test and validate our assumptions to eventually inform decisions needed before Scale Approval?
Goal of Today’s Discussion: Present the plan for initial market deployment.
S@S Overview Here

Opportunities closed per interaction
Care teams are engaging members through multiple, disconnected outreach efforts that are (1) inefficient at advancing progress on open opportunities (e.g., quality gaps) and (2) less effective at addressing members’ needs.
Problems to Be Solved
Care teams do not have unified guidance or prompts on which member should be engaged next in their day-to-day operations.
% opportunities closed with top priority members
We do not currently have a way to connect identified member needs to action taken to address that need and/or loop closure of that need in our documentation or data.
Trust & Satisfaction Score
Longitudinal engagement
Our frontline staff, and their managers, do not have clear responsibilities and performance expectations. Productivity expectations for care teams are not integrated in panel management or cadenced proactive outreach expectations.

Goals: What are we trying to achieve?

Recall: Problems we are not solving
Through stakeholder engagement, we have heard the following problems expressed. While these are important points of friction to address, we want to be explicit that we have not thought of them as in-scope for this work.
Problem Statements Not Addressed
1
We do not have standardized roles defined for Sr. CHPs and Sr. RN CMs across markets, making it difficult to provide clear career paths for our frontline teams.
2
The quality of notes in the timeline varies, the timeline is difficult to scan, and updates can be difficult to find. This means that time spent sifting through the Timeline to prepare for a call can feel like time wasted if the member doesn’t answer.
3
Tasks completed do not map 1:1 with value delivered to members. It is challenging to measure and manage against value in day-to-day operations.
4
The current External referrals feature in our timeline notes does not provide an easy way to track multiple referrals to resolve a member need  from start to finish. 
5
External referrals managed through Findhelp are not integrated back into commons requiring users to double document into multiple timeline in Commons 
6
We have disparate systems for grouping action-items, some of which require linear formatting. (Workflows, Goals, Commons Companion Quality Widget, etc.)

💬 User feedback from our advanced inbox pilot launch has been overwhelmingly positive and has also enabled early iteration with 3 bug fixes 
“I really like this! This is so much simpler to organize tasks due!”
-Kimberly Wolak RNCM
“Looks good, I am appreciating the cleaned-up look!”
-Andrew Langell Behavioral Health Specialist
“This is great! Finally I don't need to swim through tasks to figure out my day. Love it.”
-Annett Jackson-Ricketts RNCM
“I like the updated Inboxes in general. It looks much cleaner/neater in the settings panel… Solid update.” -Sarah Kaluhiokalani Senior CHP
“It looks amazing so far. I think it will make tackling my tasks feel less overwhelming. I had moved away from the to-do list and started managing my tasks off the home screen. Love the to-do list separation.”
-Amy Dean RNCM
“I appreciate that I no longer have to create a "to do" list for my tasks for the current day!”
-Chakira Smith CHP
“I like the look of this so far - it's a pretty simple adjustment versus having to filter by days of the week.”
-Jeremy Boucher Senior CHP
“I love the [due-today/this week] feature! Such a simple click of a button to get today or this weeks tasks instead of filtering by date. Much appreciated time saver!”
-Melissa McNeil CHP
“[Care Plan simplification] is probably my favorite update yet!”
-Sarah Kaluhiokalani Senior CHP

A pilot allows us to test our hypotheses, build confidence for scale and change course when necessary
Why run a pilot? To ensure the changes we’re making have the intended positive effects. A pilot lets us check those effects in an evidence based way

What data will we collect? For each new feature or solution, we’ll gather quantitative data to test hypotheses about whether those solutions make users’ jobs easier, more efficient and effective

We’ll supplement quantitative data with qualitative overlay (from user feedback, surveys) to deepen our impact and operational learnings

How will we use the data? Where quantitative data and user feedback show positive effects associated with new features and solutions, we will make any final adjustments and proceed with implementation

Where the data show no change or even unintended adverse consequences, we’ll pause, diagnose, and redesign

Where and when will we pilot?

Comprehensive Member Interactions
Problem Statement
Care teams are engaging members through multiple, disconnected outreach efforts that are (1) inefficient at advancing progress on open opportunities (e.g., quality gaps) and (2) less effective at addressing members’ needs.  This results in increased cost to the organization and inefficient use of our members’ time.

Metric Definition
Surface opportunities and tasks on member 360
Care team will be able to bundle non-task actions (opportunities) more easily during any outreach

Care teams make fewer outreaches per member per interval (e.g. month) because they are actioning on more opportunities per interaction
Total completed tasks + Pathway or Program enrollments / Total Successful Connections 

All connection attempts per member / X business days
Quality gaps surfaced as opportunities in UI and training teams with clear outreach guidance   

Non-provider roles (RNs, CHPs, member navigators) will action on more quality gaps 

Non-provider roles (RNs, CHPs, member navigators) will action on more than one quality gap per interaction
#of non- provider roles that action on quality gaps

Total action on quality / total successful connections
360 UI updates
Users will spend less time looking for contextual information to prep for calls 

Users will spend less time creating their own ‘to do’ lists
Average time spent on 360

Actions taken on 360 page 
Care pathway eligibility as an opportunity
Users will easily identify pathway eligibility and structure calls to include enrollment discussion
# enrollments (MSP target)
Launch QA program in all markets (CTLs pull charts for review)
Setting expectations that leaders will be auditing charts will increase quality of interactions and documentation
Activated member with care plan / Total activated
Utilizing Commons ecosystem/tasking for LCT campaign outreach
Baking campaign LCT actions into tasking will increase care team adherence in conducting outreach (task is surfaced in central location, task completion is incentivized in overall performance mgmt)
# campaign outreach tasks completed 

Prioritized Panel Management

Problem Statement
Care teams do not have unified guidance or prompts on which member should be engaged next in their day-to-day operations.  Current push factors include cadenced outreach, market chase lists, signal-based proactive outreach, and follow-through on member commitments; however, these can conflict with each other and have not been integrated into unified expectations.

Archive task status
Better focus member panels & inboxes, improving panel prioritization 

Create foundational observability into what work was closed because users were unable to complete it (archive) vs. successfully completed it (complete)
Baseline # archived tasks by archive reason
RCI associated tasks can be set as recurring
Recurring tasks are easy to identify and understand and aid care team members in completing tasks that need to repeat
User concept test with 5 care team members

Operationalizing Care Team Expectations
Problem Statement
Across markets, our frontline staff and their managers do not have standard responsibilities and performance expectations. These inconsistencies lead to misaligned performance expectations and hinders the integration of productivity goals within panel management and proactive outreach workflows.
