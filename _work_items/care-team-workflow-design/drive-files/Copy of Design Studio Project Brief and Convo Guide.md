# **Design Studio Project Brief**

## **Design Studio Project Brief** 

#### Project Overview

Consent status is currently surfaced in multiple, inconsistent ways across the member profile (e.g., tags, left-column entries, conditional visibility, intake steps, etc.). This makes it harder for users to see what’s missing and take action. Stakeholders, including Percepta, have requested a clearer and more unified experience.

I’m presenting 3 design options aimed at consolidating and simplifying the consent UI.

#### Goals

* Improve clarity and visibility of all required/missing consents.  
* Reduce cognitive load from fragmented UI patterns.  
* Increase action on consents by making them easier to find and complete.  
* Provide a consistent pattern that scales across workflows and roles.  
* Address stakeholder needs (e.g., inclusion of Verbal, HIE, Text message consents).


#### Structure format

* Timebox: \~30 minutes for context \+ presentation.  
* Format: Freeform discussion.  
* Focus: Gather feedback on 3 options, discuss alternative approaches, and align on a direction to bring back to stakeholders.


#### Evidence and Assumptions

* Adoption of consent features is low, but specific metrics are unclear.  
* Stakeholders report confusion due to scattered and inconsistent placement.  
* Assumption: Centralizing consent UI will improve awareness and task completion.  
* Assumption: A unified design will reduce support burden and scale better across the platform.

#### 

#### Feedback Focus

* Open to big-picture ideas and small UX improvements.  
* Which option scales best to other parts of Commons?  
* Are there patterns we should borrow or align with?  
* What might be missing?  
* How could this be stronger if redesigned from scratch?

**Design Studio Project Brief**

**Project Overview**  
 I'm sharing early explorations for two related improvements to the 360 page:

1. **Appointments widget updates:** Surface *Last Annual Provider Visit* and *Last Health Risk Assessment* to help CHPs/RNs identify if members are due, and expand upcoming appointments to show *all* upcoming—not just the next one. This gives a more complete view and supports logistical planning and member reminders.

2. **Suggested Primary in Team widget:** For members without an assigned care team, we’re introducing a *Suggested Primary* to help balance care panels and provide continuity. This placeholder updates when an APV is scheduled and disappears once the team is added.

Both updates include design tweaks to the ListItem pattern and aim to improve visibility and actionability while reducing ambiguity.

**Goals**

* Improve clarity and visibility of key care signals (APV, HRA, upcoming appts, team).

* Reduce confusion and missed opportunities by showing complete appointment data.

* Help staff identify and act on care planning opportunities more easily.

* Use consistent visual patterns across components (ListItem).

* Ensure scalable UX for future care planning needs.

**Structure format**

* **Timebox:** \~30 minutes for context \+ presentation.

* **Format:** Freeform discussion.

* **Focus:** Share UI explorations for both widgets, gather feedback on layout clarity, terminology, and perceived value, and align on which direction(s) to refine.

**Evidence and Assumptions**

* CHPs/RNs are currently unclear if members are due for APV/HRA unless they dig.

* Showing just one upcoming appointment is misleading and creates planning gaps.

* We assume surfacing more data clearly \= better proactive care and fewer member drop-offs.

* Suggested Primary reduces panel clutter and guides assignment without increasing load.

**Feedback Focus**

* Round-robin feedback on UI/UX for both Appointments and Team widget updates.

* Does the updated Appointments card make due tasks clearer?

* Is "Suggested Primary" language and placement intuitive?

* Are there opportunities to simplify or align more closely with other parts of Commons?

* What feels off or might be missing?

* How would you improve this if starting from scratch?

# **Structure & Format**

### **Structure and Format** *Toolkit of how you want to guide the team to engage with you today.* [Reference Figma’s article](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-critiques-at-figma/#_1-standard-critiques) 

**Invite other partners**

- For effective discussions and diverse feedback, consider inviting project partners, subject matter experts (SMEs), and stakeholders to your design studio sessions, depending on the project's needs and stage.


**Timebox the context setting portion**

- Ideally show the design file ahead of time. Figjam preferred.  
- Few minutes to share context and for team to internalize the information (silently)  
- Few minutes to ask clarifying questions


**Choose your feedback style and timebox it**

- Prepping feedback, few minutes for the session  
- Round-robin, few minutes max per person  
- Freeform, timebox the entire session

**Other workshop methods**

- Breakout sessions / pair critiques  
- Silent critiques  
- Various brainstorming techniques (crazy 8s, HMWs, 2x2 prioritization, impact/effort matrix, six thinking hats, etc)  
- FYIs \- no feedback, just presentation

**Follow-ups**

- Respond to comments  
- Schedule a separate pair critique session with a smaller group for a deeper dive  
- Message in slack to the group about the status of changes

# **Conversation Guide**

### **UX Themes and Goals Conversation Guide**

**Problem space and UX goals** 

* What are your hypotheses about what currently makes this space difficult for users (and/or members)? Have we validated these hypotheses, and if so how? If not, how might we validate them?  
* What UX goals do we have around this work, if any yet? Should we work on brainstorming goals today?

**UX themes**

* How does our UX theme of driving focus through simplicity apply to this work?  
* How does our UX theme of enabling care team collaboration apply to this work?  
* How does our UX theme of enabling satisfaction-building behaviors apply to this work? Have you reviewed with AIMEE?  
* Is there content and/or features that compete with this for users’ attention? Is there content/features we want to advocate for removing or streamlining? 

**Testing**

* For anything user-facing, have we tested with users or lookalikes?   
  * If yes, what did we learn? How did we incorporate that?  
  * If not, how should we plan to do that?  
* For anything member-facing, have we designed for members’ lived experience–poverty, transience, trauma–in this work? Have we tested with members or lookalikes?   
  * If yes, what did we learn? How did we incorporate that?  
    If not, how should we plan to do that?  
* For anything in design, should we plan a lightweight or more intensive evaluation?   
  * WHat’s the appropriate test intensity for this feature or solution?  
  * What do we want to learn? 

**Linkages to other team work**

* What other work does this connect to across the team?   
* Are we seeing a need for any shared work together (insights brief, service blueprint, etc.)?
