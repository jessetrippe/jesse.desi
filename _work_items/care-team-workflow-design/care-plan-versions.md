Additional Tips for Your Cityblock Health Case Study:
Healthcare-Specific Considerations:

Handle NDA content carefully - anonymize patient data, get clearance for what you show
Emphasize understanding of healthcare workflows and clinical context
Show empathy for the demanding nature of nursing work
Highlight any regulatory/compliance considerations

Storytelling Approach:

Lead with impact (put results early)
Use real artifacts (photos of sticky notes, workshop sessions, actual sketches)
Keep it scannable - hiring managers spend ~60 seconds initially
Balance depth with brevity - detailed but not overwhelming
Show your thinking process, not just the finished product

Visual Best Practices:

High-quality, clear screenshots
Annotated designs explaining decisions
Real workflow examples
Before/after comparisons
Process photos showing collaborative work
