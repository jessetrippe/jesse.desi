I designed and helped build Coyote Howl, a customer-focused mobile app that gives shippers visibility and insight into their freight network. I worked with Coyote's mobile development team, a product manager, and a stakeholder. The app was built from start to finish in about 3 months, launching first internally to sales reps and later externally to customers.

Howl had two purposes: give shippers a tool to manage and view their day-to-day freight, and provide sales reps with a demo tool to help sell Coyote to potential customers.

## Sketches

Requirements included tracking information, filtering and searching shipments, Coyote rep contact information, and notifications on shipment status changes. We also needed something that could be highlighted during sales demos.

For the demo requirement, we initially focused on a new type of navigation that would provide a fun interactive element throughout the app. After minimal user testing, we found it hard to use and not very discoverable. We decided gambling on novel navigation was too risky.

Instead, we built a new tab called Visibility to show larger trends of a customer's freight network. The charts and map made for a great demo.

## Wireframes

I built wireframes and presented them to user stakeholders, sales stakeholders, and the development team to align on content and functionality.

While the development team built backend services and the framework in Ionic and AngularJS, I built a working prototype with actual content and started testing with users. My prototype code was eventually merged with the development team's framework since both used Ionic. It's now in the production version of the app.

During testing, I discovered our menus were too deep for external customers. Vital load information was too many taps away to be useful. I modified the prototype and final design to feature contact information and primary load information directly on the load details screen.

## Final Design

The final app features Coyote's signature green along with bright charts, graphs, and maps. It has a familiar, easily discoverable menu, and each section has been simplified to eliminate unnecessary navigation depth.
