Carta companies faced challenges in effectively communicating stock-related information, such as IPO details and upcoming ESPPs, with stakeholders. Carta account managers also struggled to efficiently share required stock-related disclosures and materials, such as IPO-related communication and security information.

In the past, administrators would download large employee lists, filter them, and use email or external services like Salesforce and Mailchimp to send communications. When the filtering criteria was complex, administrators would rely on Carta staff to obtain the appropriate list of stakeholders. Due to lack of visibility, Carta was unable to monitor or control the content of these communications, which posed a security risk.

## Kickoff and research

I conducted interviews with account managers to gather insight into the issues this project aimed to address, and then researched different communication platforms. This included analyzing Carta's Investor Updates tool and external services such as Mailchimp.

After understanding the problem and typical workflows, I explored various solutions to the problem using Carta's pattern library. Then, I shared my designs with the product manager and team for feedback.

## Design exploration

Deciding whether to optimize the design for a user selecting large groups of stakeholders using Carta's relationships and data or a user building a recipient list one stakeholder a time was a challenging decision. My research led me to believe designing for the former was the best choice. Nonetheless, I presented various methods for filtering stakeholders to the team, along with my recommendation on which option to implement.

## MVP Design

The team decided to split the features into three phases, in order to launch quickly and gather feedback. As I created the MVP solution, I took into account future features such as advanced filtering, nudge or resend, removing recipients, unsend, etc.

## Usability Study and Feedback

After finalizing the designs, I conducted a user study to assess the solution's usability and gather feedback. I created a study plan, script, and scheduled 30-minute sessions with six customer administrators to review the designs and perform a task. The study helped us to verify the usability of the solution, identify missing features that would hinder adoption, and collect ideas for future features.

I consolidated my findings and presented them to the team, which helped in prioritizing features. I also shared the results and details about the study at a company-wide all-hands meeting at Carta. Based on the feedback, I made changes to the design, and the team developed the MVP solution.

## Phase Two Feature Iterations

I started working on Phase Two features, which included support for multiple users, different roles (such as read-only view), support for Carta users, the ability to remove recipients, and a more comprehensive introduction/empty state.

## Multi-Editor Support
