Amazon's 3rd-party delivery companies needed to submit driver hours, mileage, and route counts daily in order to invoice Amazon and get paid. But the work they actually completed often differed from what Amazon had planned due to route changes, delays, and other complications throughout the day.

Without a shared system, invoicing disputes were common. Companies submitted one number, Amazon expected another, and reconciliation took weeks.

A beta version of a work tracking tool had launched to three UK stations and failed. Too many assumptions about how users collected and recorded data proved wrong. I was brought on to work with and mentor a junior designer to provide a solution that met users' and Amazon's needs. The redesign took around 3 months to complete.

## Wireframes

I started by interviewing the beta testers to understand what went wrong. The core issue: the beta assumed all companies tracked work the same way. They didn't. Some recorded data by driver, others by route, others by station. The new design had to support all of these approaches.

I wireframed layouts that organized work collection in different ways and tested them with the same users who had rejected the beta. The goal was to display the right information to complete the task without overwhelming users with unnecessary metrics.

## Final Design and Prototype

Once we aligned on an approach, I split the design work with the junior designer and we built pixel-perfect designs while syncing often. Because of the beta failure, we needed to validate thoroughly before launch. I built a working prototype using actual data, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then traveled to the UK to test at the three stations that had rejected the original tool.

The redesign succeeded where the beta had failed. Users could complete their tasks efficiently regardless of how they organized their data internally. We collected feedback, refined details, and launched.

The tool reduced invoicing disputes and sped up payments for delivery partners across the network.
