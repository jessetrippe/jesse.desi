I designed and coded a portfolio and blog for BauerLatoza Studio, a Chicago architecture firm specializing in historic preservation. Working with the content from their original website, the new design needed to fit within the company's existing logo, letterhead, invoicing, and marketing materials.

The result is a site with modern navigation, improved functionality, and a cleaner look that doesn't get in the way of their work.
