Amazon's 3rd-party delivery companies were flying blind. Dispatchers had to be physically present at Amazon stations to complete their work, and once drivers left for their routes, there was no way to track progress or spot problems until drivers returned.

The information existed, but it was scattered across multiple clunky internal tools. Dispatchers needed a single view showing where routes were, where drivers were, and which deliveries were at risk.

The product manager was new to Amazon's shipping space, so my logistics expertise, business knowledge, and field observations were vital to defining all aspects of this tool. From receiving the project to launching in beta form, the project took 6 months.

## Wireframes

The product manager and I visited delivery stations to observe dispatchers completing their tasks. Watching them toggle between systems and manually track driver progress made the problem concrete.

We met with Amazon operations teams to understand their needs, then developed a timeline and scope. I wireframed several approaches, and together we selected a direction. I tested the wireframes at a local station to validate assumptions before moving forward.

## Final Design

The final tool shows route locations, driver positions, and delivery progress in a single view. Dispatchers can quickly spot exceptions and triage problems before they escalate. The design consolidated information that was previously spread across multiple systems into one efficient interface.

I presented the final designs at a delivery station for feedback. User input shaped changes that were either implemented immediately or added to the roadmap.

The tool is now used by all Amazon 3rd-party dispatchers and managers across North America, with worldwide rollout following in early 2018.
