Amazon Explore launched with strong satisfaction scores (4.8/5) but low conversion (1.2%). Customer surveys pointed to price as the main barrier. The average experience cost $52.50, which was too high for casual interest.

The solution was group sessions: one guide streaming to multiple customers instead of one. This would let guides spread their time across more paying customers, dropping the average price to around $17.

I designed the multi-customer experience for both sides: the customer UI showing other attendees with mute and raised-hand indicators, and the guide app with controls to manage multiple participants while walking and narrating.

## Kickoff and research

The timeline was tight. Leadership needed designs and tech scoping quickly. I worked in parallel with the product manager, running brainstorming sessions with engineering while researching how Zoom, FaceTime, and other video platforms handled multi-user experiences.

## Wireframes

After aligning on features, I wireframed options for both customer and guide UIs. I presented these to design peers for critique and then narrowed down to a few directions for the product manager.

## Further iteration

The team couldn't reach consensus on a direction, so I moved into higher fidelity to make the options more concrete and easier to evaluate.

## Final Design

The customer solution leaned on our tenet of building and maintaining presence: essentially getting out of the way so customers can feel immersed in the streamed environment. We used a thin black strip at the bottom showing other attendees with microphone and raised-hand status. This maximized the video stream while keeping participant awareness visible. The design borrowed from Zoom's familiar pattern but optimized for immersion rather than conversation.

Group sessions launched to beta in June. CSAT scores held above 4.0 (slightly lower than private sessions at 4.4, as expected). The average experience price dropped to $24.25 overall, with group sessions averaging $14.41, below our $17 target.

The guide app also needed to stay out of the way, but for a different reason. Guides' primary focus is delivering great live experiences, focusing on narration and their environment rather than their app. An equally important focus is their safety while walking through busy streets.

To add more features while reducing UI clutter and increasing video size, I moved shopping and in-session content into a collapsible drawer and added the attendee list with controls to mute customers and see raised hands. The design relied heavily on toast notifications and audio cues I had designed earlier for the app.

## Feedback and updates

Beta feedback from guides surfaced two issues: icons were hard to see in bright outdoor lighting at gimbal distance, and the menu toggle was too close to the selfie camera, blocking the stream when tapped.

I addressed both in a follow-up iteration.
