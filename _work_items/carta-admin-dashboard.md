Public company administrators on Carta were greeted with an unhelpful landing page after signing in. It didn't surface pending tasks, relevant metrics, or shortcuts to common actions. Users immediately navigated away to find what they needed.

The team (four engineers, a product manager, and myself) had two weeks to design and ship something better.

I started by answering three questions: What do administrators want to do? What do they actually do? What does Carta want them to do? I interviewed account managers and analyzed usage data to find the overlap.

The answers shaped the dashboard: surface pending tasks, show key metrics at a glance, and provide shortcuts to the most common workflows. I collaborated with other design teams to create a scalable dashboard structure that could be adopted across Carta's platforms.

We shipped the MVP within the two-week window. The dashboard reduced time-to-task for common actions and gave administrators a reason to start their session on the landing page instead of navigating past it.
