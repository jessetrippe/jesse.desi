Public company administrators were greeted with an unhelpful, confusing landing page when they sign in to Carta's Public platform. The team (four engineers, a product manager, and myself) was given two weeks (design and development) to create something more welcoming and useful.

I quickly gathered data by interviewing account managers and analyzing analytics trying to answer three questions: what are the most common jobs administrators want to do, what are the most common jobs they actually do, and what are the most common jobs Carta wants them to do. I used these answers to then worked with the Product Manager to determine appropriate data to display. I collaborated with other design teams to create a scalable dashboard design for multiple user types across Carta's different platforms.

The final deliverables were a simple design structure shared with other teams for adoption, a north star solution, and an MVP solution for my team to build within the allotted time. I worked with the team and made many compromises based on service and data limitations and was able to ship the dashboard within the short time-frame.
