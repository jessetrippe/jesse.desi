Amazon Explore is a virtual tour product where local guides stream live experiences to customers at home. A guide in Tokyo walks through a market while a customer in Ohio watches, asks questions, and shops for items the guide can ship to them.

I owned the design of both sides of this experience: the customer-facing streaming UI in the browser and the guide-facing mobile app used to deliver experiences.

For the customer side, I designed the in-session streaming UX/UI including audio/video controls, alerts and communication messaging, shopping confirmation, and multi-user support. The challenge was keeping UI elements out of the way so customers could feel present in the streamed environment while still having access to controls when needed.

For the guide app, I designed scheduling, hardware checks, playing in-session media content, creating shopping carts, and receiving alerts and messaging. Guides are walking through busy streets, holding a phone on a gimbal, narrating live. The app needed to be glanceable at arm's length and not distract from the experience they're delivering. I designed toast notifications, audio cues, and a minimal interface that let guides focus on their surroundings rather than their screen.

The product launched in 2020 with a 4.8/5 customer satisfaction score.
