      <p>I'm a product designer who codes. I studied Visual Communication at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, taught myself HTML & CSS, and fell in love with building for the web. I've worked for the Obama 2012 Campaign, Coyote Logistics, Amazon, Carta, and Cityblock Health, designing everything from logistics platforms and mobile apps to streaming interfaces and healthcare tools.</p>
      <p>I care about communication as much as craft. I work closely with stakeholders, engineers, and users to advocate for experiences that actually work. I'm most useful when I can move between research, design, and code.</p>
      <p>I'm currently on the product design team at Cityblock Health, working on tools for care teams serving Medicaid and Medicare populations.</p>
