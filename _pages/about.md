      <p>I'm a product designer who codes. I studied Visual Communication at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, taught myself HTML and CSS, and fell in love with building for the web. I've worked for the Obama 2012 Campaign, Coyote Logistics, Amazon, Carta, and Cityblock Health, designing everything from logistics platforms and mobile apps to streaming interfaces and healthcare tools.</p>
      <p>I care about communication as much as craft. I work closely with stakeholders, engineers, and users to advocate for experiences that actually work. I'm most useful when I can move between research, design, and code.</p>
      <p>I'm currently on the product design team at Cityblock Health, working on tools for care teams serving Medicaid and Medicare populations.</p>

    <div class="col-span-2 sm:col-start-2 md:col-span-1 md:col-start-auto">
      <h2>Test cheap, learn fast</h2>
      <p>I'd rather spend a week on a scrappy pilot than a month on a polished feature nobody wants. I test hypotheses with real users early, kill what doesn't work, and carry the insights forward.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-span-2 sm:col-start-2 md:col-span-1 md:col-start-auto">
      <h2>Remove before adding</h2>
      <p>Most products have too many features, not too few. I look at usage data and cut what isn't working. Reducing surface area often does more for users than adding new functionality.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-span-2 sm:col-start-2 md:col-span-1 md:col-start-auto">
      <h2>Alignment is design work</h2>
      <p>A good design that nobody adopts is a failed design. I spend real time on stakeholder alignment, cross-team buy-in, and making sure the people affected by a decision have a voice in it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-span-2 sm:col-start-2 md:col-span-1 md:col-start-auto">
      <h2>Design for trust, not just function</h2>
      <p>If the system behaves unexpectedly once, users stop believing in it. I think about edge cases, error states, and the moments where trust gets built or broken.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-span-2 sm:col-start-2 md:col-span-1 md:col-start-auto">
      <h2>Stay close to the code</h2>
      <p>I prototype in code when it's faster than mockups. I can speak to engineers about constraints and trade-offs. This keeps my designs grounded in what's actually buildable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-span-2 sm:col-start-2 md:col-span-1 md:col-start-auto">
      <h2>Advocate, then commit</h2>
      <p>I'll push hard for what I believe is right. But once a decision is made, I commit fully. Disagreeing and committing is part of working on a team.</p>
